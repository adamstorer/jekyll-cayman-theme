What is culture?? What is Love?
Love is a kind of mythic drama

Culture - publicly avaialable symbolic forms through which people experience and express meaning. If it is embodied in symbols then we think about ritual practices, art forms, and ceremonies.

For Geertz, culture presented aunified system, and you dind't really ask how parts of culture became meaningful.

People do not really believe in a unified system of culture. We still think of overlapping systems, to some extent.

### Distanced Culture
People know more culture than they use. As a child you had to do one thing and now you don't any more, and in that way time distances people from intense cultural experiences.

Or, maybe we don't buy it? Maybe we become aware of "true love" but don't believe in it.

Skepticism exists - competing cultural claims might require it?

But it is not just selective adoption. People also adapt the ideas others bring to them. Sometimes the things we accept don't seem like culture, they seem like real life.

## Refocusing Studies of Culture
So waht is the real task? To describe how culture is used, the varied ways it enters and shapes experience. For Geertz, culture is a context in which people act, and the context tels you everything. For Geertz, cultural systems teach and express general orientations. But how do peoel appropriate and use cultural meanings?

# Repertoires

New metaphors! What about repetoires? Remember, culture is something like a bag of tricks.

So how do people select among parts of a repertoire? Actively choosing or not choosing certain themes. And when do people shift from one part to another? If people talk about love in two different ways, there is kind of a patchwork of meaning one uses to make sense of their actions etc.

People draw from repertoires, try out rationales, and are often not concerned with the coherence between them.

TO BE FAIR - this to is socially constructed, right? This is not a ground truth about the way people reason, it is a way that Americans often come to reason in the face of not being socialized into some other method of reasoning.

But swidler says there is not coherence around a simple metaphor for a particular phenomenon. To be fair, Swidler chose from a particularly abstract phenomenon.

1. Cultural meanings give analytic distance to experience, and leverage over problems of action
2. Culture is mobilized piecemeal, to tinker at the edges or to defend existing patterns of life.

So why call it culture?
1. A cultural repertoire allows people to move among situations, finding terms in which to orient action within each situation.
2. People orient themselves partly by bouncing their ideas off the cultural alternatives made apparent in their environment.

But deeper than in a debate where you are trying to justify yourself or make sense of something, what about the deeply held understanding?
The same things tend to happen. When you come to a problem you cannot handle with a single frame you try out another one.

<def>Why do people change cultural frames in the midst of a discussion?: Either they are trying to make an argument that will convince someone else, or they are trying to overcome deficiencies in their argument by taking another approach</def>

So people switch frames, but they also have to be prepared for certain scenes. Swidler used different vignettes to make sense of different scenes. That is, people use analogies, particular scenes, metaphors, to try and make sense of what they think about something.

# Part 2 - How Culture Works: Love Stories

>IN the powerful Weberian formulation, ideas influence action when they are coherent and when they are applied fully to daily life. In exploring such variation in the talk of ordinary people, I am trying to establish whether these dimensions of culture's use help account for when and why culture makes a difference. I argue here and in subsequent chapters that these variations, while real and important, do not provide the best tools for analyzing culture's effects on action and experience. p.45

Ok, so what is useful instead?
1. People vary in how many different repertoires they draw on
2. People differ in the ways they integrate culture and experience. How actively do people bring culture to bear on their experience. Do cultural lessons or programs for action resist revision by experience, or do they become updated?
3. Is there some coherence in the ways in which people draw upon repertoires?

## Cultured Capacities and Strategies of Action

What do people use culture for? Shouldn't it be for evrything though? How is culure used to construct, maintain, and refashion the cultured capacities that constitute actors' basic repertoires for action.

1. Culture lets you be a certain kind of self. Geertz's moods and motivations, enable you to adopt a line of conduct and carry it out.
2. Culture helps people internalize skills, styles, and habits.
3. Culture marks group membership. Boundaries buddy!

Swidler has a typification of notions of Culture
1. Geertz - Culture is outside symbols which create a general mood. It is pervasive.
2. Weber - Culture shapes goals and the means they think will get them there. Ideas are like switchmen that motivate us along a track. Culture affects action by providing its ends and constraining its means.
3. Parsons - Like Weber, but with values substituted for ideas. We are goal oriented actors and our values guide us towards certain goals. Sociology can tell us why people have certain goals.
Parsons is wrong because
a. Culture shapes people by shaping their values is not supported by evidence.At least deep enduring values.
b. At a macro level, it is too easy to see that some deep societal values are motivating others.

4. Joas - There is a reciprocal tradition of goals and means. Perception and cogntion is a phase of acion by which action is directed and redirected in its situational contexts.

Swidler sees herself as a fan of Joas, and argues that strategies of action take place in this way.
Swidler calls her model an identity model.
1. People develop lines of action based on who they already think they are.
a. capacities shape the lines of action they find promising
b.  A great deal of culture operates by attaching meanings to the self.

## Settled and Unsettled Lives
Unsettled - New strategies of action are being developed and tried out
Settled - People are operating within established strategies of action.

Culture works differently in the different times. For instance, Adults settle into music taste whereas chldren search. Children try on possible selves.

In some ways people hold onto some form of their identity, and in other ways they may search for new thing sin unsettled times.

Culture becomes coherent when people try to make a coherent plan. That is, in divorce, some people make a coherent plan to fix their lives.

### Modes of Culture's Influence on Action
Settled lives - culture is intimiately integrated with action, ubiquitous and hard to disentangle.
Unsettled LIvs - People use culture to organize new strategies of action and to model new ways of thinking and feeling. The new patterns are in tension with previous modes of actiona nd experience.

SO how embedded are people in their culture?
1. Ideology - Explicit, less embedded, and open to challenge.
2. Tradition - Shares some features of both. It might be taken for granted, but it is also visible and sometimes contested.
3. Common Sense - Not at all explicit, uncrecognized, simple common sense.

<def>Ideology for Swidler: An articulated, self-conscious belief and ritual system, aspiring to offer a unified answer to problems of social action.</def>
<def>Tradition for Swidler: Articulated cultural beliefs and practices, but ones that present themselves as fixed, expected parts of life.</def>

Ideologies usually define some type of community with a boundary that is known and some self consciousness to its action.
Traditions define groups but they are not as closed or exclusive. There are degrees of loyalty to traditions.
Common sense is not exclusive to the group, but it is also pervasive.

IN unsettled times, ideology is more focused.

# Part 3 - Culture from the Outside IN

How do different explanations exist side by side? There are essnetially different love myths that we can draw upon.

Images of romantic love resurface even if you disavow them. They are stowed somewhere in your brian and the connection is there. Neither myth draws out the other because people employ their notions in different contexts.

Institutions also exist (like marriage) which help shape people's action, reinforce certain notions.

Culture can sometimes be more coherent on first glance. Insituttions (like marriage) provide coherence because people shape action around isntitutional constraints. Eh.

People really do look at love in different ways. People develop certain notions of the self and these are kind of the deep ideas that move people along.

>This chapter and the last, focusing on institutions, have offered one answer to the question of why culture might develop coherent patterns even though individuals operate quite happily with diffuse, often incomplete and internally contradictory cultural resources. This cultural structuring by instiutions might be thought of as operating from the outside in, organizing disperesd cultural materials the way the field surrounding a manget iron filings or the way the gravity fo the sun orients the planets. That is, as persons orient themselves to institutional demands and institutional dilemmas, they continually reproduce structured cultural understandings, even when those structured pieces do not add up to an internally cohernt whole.

But culture exists outside of how individuals think. They think about what it would mean to others, what kind of shared codes certain actions might communicate. Also, certain logics vary by context. The situation may present possibilites for coherent cultural action that are not present at other times.

Institutions also structure meanings - but aren't they also codified logics, which in the end serve as some mix of ideology, tradition, and common sense? They also provide the BASIS for shared culture, whereas I think that maybe movies and tv provide this.

Institutions create dlilemnas and individuals must make culturally mediated life strategies . So really there are two questions:
1. How deeply, coherently, or fully culture is internalized
2. How powerfully culture influences action. - It depends on the codes, contexts, and institutions.

There is an outside-in that we must consider in addition to the inside out, and this is something we must respond to.
