Abstract: "From its very beginnings, the social study of culture has been polarized between structur足alist theories that treat meaning as a text and investigate the patterning that provides relative autonomy and pragmatist theories that treat meaning as emerging from the contingencies of individual and collective action-so-called practices-and that analyze cultural patterns as reflections of power and material interest. In this article, I present a theory of cultural pragmatics that transcends this division, bringing meaning structures, contingency, power, and materiality together in a new way. My argument is that the materiality of practices should be replaced by the more multidimensional concept of performances. Drawing on the new field of performance studies, cultural pragmatics demonstrates how social performances, whether individual or collective, can be analogized systematically to theatrical ones. After defining the elements of social performance, I suggest that these elements have become "de-fused" as societies have become more com足plex. Performances are successful only insofar as they can "re-fuse" these increasingly disentangled elements. In a fused performance, audiences identify with actors, and cultural scripts achieve verisimilitude through effective mise-en-scene. Performances fail when this relinking process is incomplete- the elements of performance remain apart, and social action seems inauthentic and artificial, failing to persuade. Refusion, by contrast, allows actors to communicate the meanings of their actions successfully and thus to pursue their interests effectively."

>From its very beginnings, the social study of culture has been polarized between structur足alist theories that treat meaning as a text and investigate the patterning that provides relative autonomy and pragmatist theories that treat meaning as emerging from the contingencies of individual and collective action-so-called practices-and that analyze cultural patterns as reflections of power and material interest. In this article, I present a theory of cultural pragmatics that transcends this division, bringing meaning structures, contingency, power, and materiality together in a new way. My argument is that the materiality of practices should be replaced by the more multidimensional concept of performances. Drawing on the new field of performance studies, cultural pragmatics demonstrates how social performances, whether individual or collective, can be analogized systematically to theatrical ones. After defining the elements of social performance, I suggest that these elements have become "de-fused" as societies have become more com足plex. Performances are successful only insofar as they can "re-fuse" these increasingly disentangled elements. In a fused performance, audiences identify with actors, and cultural scripts achieve verisimilitude through effective mise-en-scene. Performances fail when this relinking process is incomplete: the elements of performance remain apart, and social action seems inauthentic and artificial, failing to persuade. Refusion, by contrast, allows actors to communicate the meanings of their actions successfully and thus to pursue their interests effectively.

There is kind of a continuum of how connected a society is - in a connected society there is a shared symbol system in which rituals make perfect sense to everyone. In a disconnected society nothing makes sense to anyone. But in a disconnected society you kind of need to produce this belief.

>At both the micro and the macro levels, both among individuals and between and
within collectivities, our societies still seem to be permeated by symbolic, ritual-like
activities. It is precisely this notion of "ritual-like," however, that indicates the puzzle
we face. We are aware that very central processes in complex societies are symbolic,
and that sometimes they are also integrative, at the group, intergroup, and even
societal level. But we also clearly sense that these processes are not rituals in the
traditional sense p. 528

>The gist of my argument can be stated simply. The more simple the collective organization,
the less its social and cultural parts are segmented and differentiated, the more
the elements of social performances are fused. The more complex, segmented, and
differentiated the collectivity, the more these elements of social performance become
de-fused. To be effective in a society of increasing complexity, social performances
must engage in a project of re-fusion. To the degree they achieve re-fusion,
social performances become convincing and effective-more ritual-like. To the degree
that social performances remain de-fused, they seem artificial and contrived, less like
rituals than like performances in the pejorative sense. They are less effective as a result.
Failed performances are those in which the actor, whether individual or collective, has
been unable to sew back together the elements of performance to make them seem
connected seamlessly. This performative failure makes it much more difficult for the
actor to realize his or her intentions in a practical way.p. 529


### COlelctive REpresentations

People have scripts waiting in the wings - our collective representations for social performance. These can range from myths, to oral traditions, to scripts prepared by playwrights or journalists. They can be more or less effective.

The patterned representations are put into practice by *people*. The actor is supposed to make it seem real.

There is also an oberver/audience for the action.

>Two pathways lead out from the discussion thus far. The analytic model can be
developed further, elaborating the nature of each factor and its interrelations with the
others. I will take up this task in a later section. Before doing so, I will engage in
a historical discussion. I wish to explore how the analytical model I have just laid out,
despite the fact it is so far only presented very simply, already provides significant
insight into the central puzzle of ritual and rationalization with which I introduced
this article and that defines its central question. p.533

# COnditions for Perfomrativity: Historical Transformations


WHy does the theater exist? In earlier societies
>Rituals in early societies, I wish to suggest, were not so much practices as performances,
and in this they indeed are made of the same stuff as social actions in more complex
societies. In an introduction to his edition of Turner's posthumous essays, Schechner
(1987:7) suggested that "all performance has at its core a ritual action." It is better, I think,
to reverse this statement, and to say that all ritual has at its core a performative act p.534

Ritual performances reflect the social structure and cultures of their society. It is easy to connect with people in less complex societies, where you can clearly link the performance and the social structure?

Performances were rituals in early society, partially because the set of beliefs people have is shared with all members of the group.

>Through the painting, masking, and reconfiguring of
the physical body, the actors in these performances seek not only metaphorically but
literally to become the text, their goal being to project the fusion of human and totem,
"man and God," sacred and mundane. The symbolic roles that define participation in
such ritualized performances emerge directly, and without mediation, from the other
social roles actors play. p.10

So what about in more complex settings? We still get fused performances with total buy in in the combination of sacred and profane. It happens more in primary groups where you can get total buy in.

But now in complex societies actors relate differently to symbls.. Text based societies require literacy, and a spread of power.

>In terms of the model I am developing here, these empirical accounts suggest
de-fusion among the elements of performance: (I) the separation of written foreground
texts from background collective representations; (2) the estrangement of the means of
symbolic production from the mass of social actors; and (3) the separation of the elites
who carried out central symbolic actions from their mass audiences. p.539

Greek theater emerged from religions unity, but in the process of differentiation, the rituals became performances.

>What I have proposed, rather, is a universally shared form of social development,
one that responds to growing complexity in social and cultural structure.
Ritual moved toward theater throughout the world's civilizations in response to
similar social and cultural developments-the emergence of cities and states, of
religious specialists, of intellectuals, and of needs for political legitimation. p.543

>The historical story I am telling here addresses the puzzle at the core of this article:
Why do ritually organized societies give way not to social orders regulated simply by
instrumentally rational action but instead to those in which ritual-like processes
remain vital in some central way?
It is vital for this story to see that the emergence of theater was more or less
simultaneous with the emergence of the public sphere as a compelling social stage. For
it was, in fact, roughly during the same period as theatrical drama emerged that social
drama became a major form of social organization-and for reasons that are much
the same. p.544

The public stage is really a symbolic forum in which actors have increasing freedom to create and to project performances of their reasons etc. It creates collective action through symbolic integration that is really like mechanical solidarity.

People take the stage to make their case often in a way that fuses these things.

## Re-Fusion
>The goal of secular performances, whether on stage or in society, remains the same as
the ambition of sacred ritual. They stand or fall on their ability to produce psychological
identification and cultural extension. The aim is to create, via skillful and
affecting performance, the emotional connection of audience with actor and text and
thereby to create the conditions for projecting cultural meaning from performance to
audience. To the extent these two conditions have been achieved, one can say that the
elements of performance have become fused p. 547

>On the level of everyday life, authenticity is thematized by such
questions as whether a person is "real"-straightforward, truthful, and sincere. Action
will be viewed as real if it appears sui generis, the product of a self-generating actor who is
not pulled like a puppet by the strings of society. An authentic person seems to act
without artifice, without self-consciousness, without reference to some laboriously
thought-out plan or text, without concern for manipulating the context of her actions,
and without worries about that action's audience or its effects. The attribution of
authenticity, in other words, depends on an actor's ability to sew the disparate
elements of performance back into a seamless and convincing whole. If authenticity
marks success, then failure suggests that a performance will seem insincere and faked:
the actor seems out of role, merely to be reading from an impersonal script, pushed
and pulled by the forces of society, acting not from sincere motives but to manipulate
the audience. p.548

>The emergence of the script as an independent element reflects
the relative freedom of performance from background representations. From within a
broader universe of meanings, performers make conscious and unconscious choices
about the paths they wish to take and the specific set of meanings they wish to project.
These choices are the scripts-the action-oriented subset of background understandings.
If script is meaning primed to performance, in theatrical drama this priming is
usually, though not always, sketched out beforehand. In social drama, by contrast,
scripts more often are inferred by actors. p.550

The performane allows for a cognitive simplification, providing a way in which people can make sense of something.

There are many aspects to this, including sign equipment. Also, the actor miust fuse with the role, and then on the other side with the audience, in order to create the connection.  

Really we have a connection between pragmatic/rational and performative/symbolic.

>From the normative point of view, performative fusion must be unmasked, and
rational deliberation provides the means. From a cultural-sociological perspective,
however, embracing rationality as a norm does not mean seeing social action as rational
in an empirical way. Culture is less toolkit than storybook. Why else are critical efforts
to question a performance almost always accompanied by creative efforts to mount
counterperformances in turn (Alexander 2004)?   p.568
