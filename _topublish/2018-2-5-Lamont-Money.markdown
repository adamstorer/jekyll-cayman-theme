# Chapter One - Questions and the Stage

How do people get high value things? There are a lot ofinformal resources that help you get there. It also is important to fit in. How does the upper middle class value cultural styles?

So how do people delimit worthy and unworhty people? These are symbolic boundaries, like saying that "we" are better than "them."

To do this, Lamont interviews white male upper-middle class members in NYC, Paris and Clermont-Ferrand.

WE may see some importance with cultivated dispositions. Bourdieu argues that poeple have tastes based on cultivated dispositions.

IN the US there are surveys that try and get at taste, but open ended questions provide a better picture.

This study looks at purity as something that people use in understanding those that are better or worse. So what is differences are at the center of their maps of perception and waht differences are ignored.  We see that there are really three boundaries here:
1. Moral Boundaries - Drawn on the basis of moral character, such as honesty or work ethic
2. Socioeconomic Boundaries - Judgements on social position in terms of wealth, power, or profession.
3. Cultural Boundareis - Drawn on the basis of education, intelligence, manners, tastes and high culture.

 What do we end up getting?
1. An importance of moral boundaries that has previously been ignored.
2. People stress socioeconomic and moral boundaris of cultural in the US, and moral and cultural in France.

>The implications of these findings for the􀃘tions
of Marxist structuralist, and rational choice theorists are discussed.
􀃙ticular, m; lfndings shed doubt􀃚;;-th􀃛 .. ;:;;tological models of human
nature central to these approaches, as the latter assumes that human beings
give analytical primacy to socioeconomic resources (and boundaries
or status) over other types of resources. The implications of my findings
for the influential contribution of Pierre Bourdieu are also analyzed; the 􀀉,;, __ . __ ..,.,􀀊,--..... work of this French sociologist now represents one of the most influential
trends in the sociology of culture and in cultural anthropology. My data
suggest that Bourdieu greatly underestimates the importance of moral
boundaries while he exaggerates the importance of cuLtural and socio
economic. boundaries. In addition, assumptions that are central to his
concepts of power fi􀃞ld are contradicted by my data. Some of these criticisms
will be briefly introduced in the first chapters of this volume, but
they will be brought together at the end of the.bo()k. p. 5


There is some information here additionally on symbolic boundaries - "conceptual distinctions that we make to categorize objects, people, practices, and even time and space." p.9

There are those that we want to include in our category, those we wish to exclude, and that which we are not concerned about.

>The people excluded by our boundaries are those with whom we,
refuse to associate and those toward whom rejection and aggression are
showed, and 􀆱openly marked, by way of insuring that "you understand
that h􀆲􀆳tter than you are." p.10

That is, within symbolic boundaries there is distance behavior and friendly behavior.

Boundaries are produced from available culture and spaital resources.

Why do we draw boundaries? We try to make sense of who we are and who our grup is. We are imposing order. The men who hold these boundaries in their heads are gatekeepers to social status.

# Chapter Two - The IMportance of Being Honest

Sometimes popele like that they are simple, honest, and keep their word. So how do we understand what an honst or moral person is?

We sometimes think of phonies or social climbers.

>The phony is a genuinely American category which has no adequate
equivalent in French.3 It was used again and again by John Bailey and
others to describe people who are not sincere; who pretend to know more
than they do, or to be something they are not; who have no substance
and judge a book by its cover. They "do things that are totally without
basis"; they try to put on a show. p.26

The social climber treats their subordinates poorly.

Americans think of morality in terms of sex, but French don't.

>Along similar lines, when asked to rank twentythree
qualities in terms of their desirability, only 3 5 percent of the French
I talked to in contrast to 57 percent of the American ranked honesty first
Also, when asked which one of twenty-three negative character traits
they considered to be the worst, 20 percent of the French chose "devious"
compared to 31 percent of the Americans. Furthermore, of the French,
only 6 percent chose 11low moral standards11 as the worst trait in contrast
to 20 percent of the Americans.9 These findings are reflected in a crossnational
survey which asked respondents if the Ten Commandments still
apply in their lives. This survey revealed that only 45 percent of the
French male professionals, managers, and businessmen consider these
commandments to apply to themselves, in contrast to 80 percent of the
Americans in these same categories p.29

the french have other issues, Intellectual honesty is one. That is you must be consistent with yourself in your thoughts and ideas. There is also the salaud, someone who lacks intellectual honesty and is ready to sacrifice others for his own interests.

>The salaud shows no group or class solidarity, informs on his
schoolmates, underpays his workers, breaks strikes, and is ready to disown
his friends for personal advantage p. 31

>The ranking of interviewees on the moral scale reveals that moral
status signals are roughly as highly valued as cultural and socioeconomic
status signals by French and American interviewees, 19 and that both
groups basically equally stress morality in their boundary work.20 Therefore,
contrary to recent claims, morality does remain quite salient in contemporary
America, or at least in its influential upper-middle class p.32

## Moral Character in the Workplace

These people rarely live for after work, they do what they like. They are concerend with career development.
>to understand which norms act as a medium for power
relations by framing people's lives and limiting their opportunities, it is
crucial to explore the character traits that are most valued in uppermiddle-
class work settings p.33

While asking about the best and worst coworkers, Lamont identified trust as an important mechanism. Are we straightforward or devious?
>But again, moral character is not clearly revealed upon first encounter and
must be deduced from other external signals. Because there is always
more than one plausible definition of a situation, the construction of others
as "pure" or "impure" depends, as suggested by Kanter, on the display
of homosocial characteristics. Hence the importance of operating style,
lifestyle, personality, external appearance, modes of self-presentation, interactional
behavior, and projection of general attitudes. Knowing how
to read and signal trust is crucial to organizational life p.34

So one must signal trustworthiness (morality) in order to be considered "us" and thus in order to get stuff. YOu need the right amount of ambition not to be a loser or a social climber. If you avoid conflict you're a good team player. It is important not to harp on power differentials.

IN France, people are less concerned. Some poeple think people who work too hard are suckers. Both cultures rely on competency, but it means different things, general competence in france vs specialized expertise in the US.

(The distinctions between the types of boundaries Lamont makes is unreflexive. We are talking about competences as a moral thing.) In some cases, firm loyalty and integrity are valued.

What accounts or these differences? Perhaps partly there is some religious accountint. However, religion is more complicated, not paritcularly important in France. Though some American christians draw important moral boundaries regarding religioisity.

>These fundamentalists, as well as a Christian Scientist and a few others,
feel superior to those who are less religious; they are convinced that
they are "way ahead" on a scale of hierarchalization that often remains
unknown to those being judged inferior. p.55

(Again, is this really a moral boundary?)

In the end, moral boundaries are rougly equal in countries, although some of the dimenions vary insalience.

>While sociologists such as Bellah et al. suggest that morality is losing
importance in American society, this chapter has clearly demonstrated
that moral boundaries are still very salient at the discursive level in the
culture of the American upper-middle classes. Morality, however, is less
defined in terms of communalism than in terms of work ethics, humility,
conspicuous- honesty, and straightforwardness.

# The World of Success, Money, and Power

WE start with a guy who is tired of all the worldly success.

>Whereas people who draw moral boundaries take moral character as
indicative of an individual's worth, individuals who draw socioeconomic
boundaries - define desirability on the basis of social position as read
through professional prestige, race, financial standing, class background,
power, and visibility in prestigious social circles p. 63

People who draw socioeconomic boundaries are simply concerned with how sccesful you are. People here are envious of those who are doing better than them. Here then, we must understand a different set of standards of evaluation. What is success?

For some, they are willing to talk about the importance of money, but for others they are not. Some are materialistic but do not think about it in terms of money. Some rich people are above thinking about money.

For the Americans, money means freedom. For the french, not as much. For the French rich, it is not necesarily about income, but for Americans is income a big part of it?

In France though,  people want power. BUt in a weird, hard to make sense of way. Americans draw relations based on money and power, the French on power but in a paradoxical way.

Membership to groups is another thing that signals power.
>The interviews did not reveal clear cross-national differences concerning
the frequency at which participation in prestigious organizations
is used in boundary work. p. 75

In smaller towns with intertwined networks, acceptance in clubs is another thing.


### Class, Race, Gender, Ethnicity
Americans almost never refer to these things. They sometimes might say "lazy people who live in the inner city"

However, Americans downplay the role of class in occupation.

The French use class often, and talk with disdain bout lower class occuptions. People also often think of themselves as elite.

Many people said they were not interested in looking at socioeconomic boundaries.

>For instance, evidence suggests that moral and socioeconomic boundaries
are less autonomous from one another in the United States than they
are in France: for Americans, and for Hoosiers in particular who draw
stronger moral boundaries than their New York counterparts do,64 only
when accompanied by moral purity is socioeconomic success admired.65
Therefore, if Americans attach great importance to success-related traits
such as ambition, dynamism, a strong work ethic, and competitiveness,
it might be because these traits are doubly sacred because they are read
as signals of both moral and socioeconomic purity. p.84


# Most of my Friends Are Refined

Some eopple feel superior to those who watch television every day, to conformists, or to those who talk aabout money. This is a kind of cultural excludor.

HOw do people make sense of intelligience, self-actualization and sophistication?

Everyone wants to think their friends are smart. The french think if someone is more critical, they are smarter. Americans see competence as intelligence. The french, for instnace, are concerned about bad grammar.

For Americans
>they've seen, how they fit into society"
(environment specialist, New York). The line dividing "us" and "them" is
less a sens critique and proper diction than the mastery of broad information
about the world. p. 95

Americans stress self-actualization. That means doing thing sand doing things succesfully.

More and more I agree with myself that Lamont is not reflexive enough regarding the boundaries that she herself has drawn. Maybe this deals iwth it

>When stressing self-actualization as a type of high status signal,
people might simultaneously draw cultural, moral, and socioeconomic
boundaries, equating self-actualization with showing proof of moral character
and with having the "right" dispositions for being socially successful.
T he centrality of self-actualization in American upper-middle-class culture
could be explained by the very fact that it can be taken to indirectly
signal high ranking on the moral, cultural, and socioeconomic status
hierarchies p.100

What about bad taste? People who do not attach importance to culture, poeple who are not refined.

>Refinement is the central value for the culturally exclusive like Phillipe.
Members of this category generally describe their friends as refined. It is
a question of "their manners, their speech, their vocabulary. It is a refinement
which is not only measured in terms of manners, but [also in terms
of] intellectual refinement ... [They] know how to do things within the
proper measure" (corporate lawyer, Paris) p. 102

Americans sometimes pride themselves as being adaptable. sometime speople who are less cosmopolitan are worse.

>Another contrast between the French and American respondents lay
in the domains of cultural sophistication that they particularly value.
There are similarities for sure: like the French, Americans highly value
having a strong political and economic culture (i.e., being well-informed)
Recent history is also important. Americans who draw strong cultural
boundaries, however, put more emphasis than the French do on familiarity
with scientific and technological developments, while overall they
attach less importance to humanistic culture. p.106

Americans also believe there is an individualist style of culture, how you dress is your business.

>American cultural laissez-faire also appears in the fact that, in contrast
to the Frenchmen I talked with, more Americans express tolerant attitudes
toward others: when probed on feelings of superiority and inferiority,
they are slightly more likely to say that they do not feel inferior or superior
to anyone, that their taste is not better than others', and that they
like everybody p. 116

Americans are also more interested perhaps in innovation. American tastes are less classical.

There is also an anti-intellectualism in Americans.
>Anti-intellectualism and anticosmopolitanism can be interpreted as a
questioning of cultural standards of hierarchalization and as an attempt to
subordinate- them to moral ones, cultural sophistication being seen as a
superfluous quality in comparison with sincerity or honesty for instance p. 125


# Explaining National differences

>Combining structural and cultural factors, I
offer a multicausal explanation that suggests that boundary work varies
with the cultural resources people have at their disposal as well as with
their structural situations and the characteristics of the societies in which
they live. More specifically, on the structural side, a number of remote
and proximate environmental factors have increased the probability of
individuals drawing one type of boundary rather than another. p. 129

>Combining structural and cultural factors, I
offer a multicausal explanation that suggests that boundary work varies
with the cultural resources people have at their disposal as well as with
their structural situations and the characteristics of the societies in which
they live. More specifically, on the structural side, a number of remote
and proximate environmental factors have increased the probability of
individuals drawing one type of boundary rather than another. p.130

We see that there are national patterns in boundary work - France is more likely to draw cultural boundaries, peripheries are more likely to draw moral boundaries.

Boundary work attempts to show that remote structural factors also play a role.
1. Volantirst view of tool kits (people use what is effective to them) - the nation you are in determines what is available to you, this is where structure comes in.
2. Determinist approaches argue there is one chocie, but really individuals actively choose what's going on. There is some relative autonomy.

In other words, there are national repertoires at work. Things like different structures of schools and the mass media play a role.

>Until very recently French radio and television
stations were all state-owned, and many of them gave a relatively
large time for cultural programming. This undoubtedly strengthened cultural
boundaries by making high culture available to a wider audience at
a time when television advertising was banned p. 141

France also financescultural instutions. Whose pulling who here though right?

In essence there are two additional factors here:
1. Remote factors (social structure stuff, how institutions funciton)
2. Proximate Factors - Gender, race, things that are close to you can you can see.

# The Nature of Internal Class Boundaries

What about internal variation?
>To unearth them, I compare groups of
individuals who, due to their occupation or social trajectory, have different
market conditions and different relationships with economic rationality:
social and cultural specialists with for-profit workers, intellectuals
with nonintellectuals, the upwardly with the downwardly mobile, and
those whose family has been part of the upper-middle class for several
generations with those who have recently entered the group. Examining
these internal variations helps us gain a better knowledge of the
role played by proximate structural conditions in shaping boundaries p. 150

For Profit and Not-For-Profit people draw boundaries differently.

>A comparison of individual scores on the moral, cultural, and socioeconomic
dimensions reveals that social and cultural specialists are somewhat
more culturally exclusive than for-profit workers;'9 that the latter
group is slightly more likely to draw strong socioeconomic boundaries 20
than social and cultural specialists 21 and that moral boundaries are equally
valued by both groups.22 I am suggesting that the proximate structural
positions of the men I talked to, as revealed by their relationship with
the realization of profit, do shape their boundary work p. 157

WHat is doing the shaping here? Didn't people decide to do these things? Is this an uncharacterized category with which people draw boundaries in general?

# Conclusion

>We will see that upper-middle-class men can unwittingly contribute to
social reproduction by mobilizing in the workplace typically middle-class
high status signals. Against poststructuralists who argue that meanings
always generate inequality, I specify the conditions under which symbolic
boundaries can foster objective socioeconomic boundaries, and I discuss
the effect of variations in the strength of subjective boundaries on objective
socioeconomic boundaries; this topic is only rarely explored. p.174

>More particularly,
I view symbolic boundaries as a necessary but insufficient condition
for the creation of socioeconomic inequality, and I suggest that only
strong boundaries can generate inequality and that differentiation does
not necessarily lead to hierarchy.
As we just saw, exclusion is often the p. 178

HOw is this different from Bourdieu?
1. Bourdieu thinks that differences directly lead to a hierarchy, and Lamont says how important those differences are to poeple is a mediator.
2. Bourdieu does not think about morality.
3. Bourdieu is too focused on France, which exagerates cultural boundaries.
4. Bourdieu argues worldviews are determined by proximate environmental factors, there are also remote macrostrctructural determinants.
5. Bourdieu thinks fields operate with relational structures of different types of capital, but there is not universal value for these things? And there is no autonomy in what is important. And there is no morality at play, just an exchange  of capitals.
