In a bureaucracy, or any organized social structure, authority is in the office,not in the person. People must also act with respect to each other in certain ways so that office type formality overturns hostile private attitudes.

>In these bold outlines, the positive attainments and functions of bureau- cratic organization are emphasized and the internal stresses and strains of such structures are almost wholly neglected. p.561

At the same time, people seem to not like bureaucracy. There are three issues people bring up:

<def>Trained Incapacity: In Bureaucracy, the formal training that does not fit the needs of things outside the training. For instance, chickens are trained to respond to a bell for food, but will also respond to the bell when being led to the slaughter.</def>
<def>Occupational Psychosis: As a result of day to day routines, people develop belief structures. Psychosis is a character of the mind. These develop within an individual from a particular role in a particular organization.</def>

In both situations we focus on what bureaucracy fails at, rather than what it succeeds with. The idea is that bureaucrats are put in a situation where they learn discipline and a particular bureaucratic sentiment. That is the formal rationality.

>There is a margin of safety, so to speak, in the pressure exerted by these sentiments upon the bureaucrat to conform to his patterned obligations, in much the same sense that added allowances (precautionary over- estimations) are made by the engineer in designing the supports for a bridge. But this very emphasis leads to a transference of the sentiments from the aims of the organization onto the particular details of behavior required by the rules. Adher- ence to the rules, originally conceived as a means, becomes transformed into an end- in-itself; there occurs the familiar process of displacement of goals whereby "an instrumental value becomes a terminal value. p.563

That is, the job bends the man in certain ways, it directs them to focus specifically on formalized procedures. This is a different take than Whyte, who argues that man is bent to the job from Day 1. Even in college.

Here is a summary of Merton's notion of the process:
1. Bureaucracy requires reliability of response and devotion to regulations.
2. Devotion to the rules leads to them becoming absolutes. They no longer are there to address something, they merely exist.
3. This interferes with adaptation under special conditions.
4. The elements which produce efficiency also produce inefficiency.

>The official is tacitly expected to and largely does adapt his thoughts, feelings, and actions to the prospect of this career. But these very devices which increase the probability of conformance also lead to an over-concern with strict adherence to regulations which induces timidity, conservatism, and tech- nicism p.564

The workers together also are part of the same team and there is no in-group agression within the bureaucracy. Informal reactions tend to arise when there is a threat to the group.

And this is not only because of vested interests!

The takeaway from this paper is:
>This is to say that through sentiment-formation, emotional dependence- upon bureaucratic symbols and status, and affective involvement in spheres of competence and authority, there develop prerogatives involving atti- tudes of moral legitimacy which are established as values in their own right, and are no longer viewed as merely technical means for expediting adminis- tration.

There is also a depersoanlization the role that makes the bureaucrat think differently about impersonality. People ignore peculiarities because in the bureaucratic system there are no peculiarities. The bureaucrat also wields some power over those they attempt to serve, and this can lead to certain attitudes.

>Thus, with respect to the relations be- tween officials and clientele, one struc- tural source of conflict is the pressure for formnal and impersonal treatment when individual, personalized consideration is desired by the client. The conflict mnay be viewed, then, as deriving from the introduction of inappropriate attitudes and relationships. Conflict within the bureaucratic structure arises from the converse situation, namely, when person- alized relationships are substituted for the structurally required impersonal rela- tionship p.9

There is some discussion of primary group attitudes (that is general social attitudes) and how they relate to secondary group attitudes (that is organizational attitudes, such as bureaucracy) They come into conflict when they ask for different things - to be seen as a person or a cog in a machine. This paper is great!
