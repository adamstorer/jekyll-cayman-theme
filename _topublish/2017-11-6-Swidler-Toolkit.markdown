Abstract: "Culture influences action not by providing the ultimate values towards which action is oriented, but by shaping a repertoire or "tool kit" of habits, skills, and styles from which people construct strategies of action. Two models of cultural influence are developed, for settled and unsettled cultural periods. In settled periods, culture independently influences action, but only by providing resources from which people can construct diverse lines of action. In unsettled periods, explicit ideologies directly govern action, but structural opportunities for action determine which among competing ideologies survive in the long run. This alternative view of culture offers new opportunities for systematic, differentiated arguments about culture's causal role in shaping action."

New Notes:
<def>Old understanding of culture according to Swidler: Culture shapes action by supplying ultimate ends or values toward which action is directed, thus making values the central causal element of culture.</def>

Swidler sees culture as belifes, rituals, art, ceremonies, languages, stories, and rituals of daily life.

But people invested in explaining things via culture use values as the only real way to understand causal significance.

Swidler's treatment of Weber - humans are motivated by ideal and material interests. Ideal interests are ends-oriented. Interests influence action. Parsons is even worse by taking the values that Weber sees as historically constructed and makes them ahistorical.
>Parsons does not treat values as concrete symbolic elements (like doctrines, rituals, or myths) which have histories and can actually be studied. Rather, values are essences around which societies are constituted. They are the unmoved mover in the theory of action.

Using values to understand what people want is problematic because...I'm not sure why. In Cultures of Poverty, poor and rich people value the same things.
>People may share common aspirations, while remaining profoundly different in the way their culture organizes their overall pattern of behavior. Culture in this sense is more like a style or a set of skills and habits than a set of preferences or wants. p.4

You have to know how to do things to get what you want, and strategizing about doing this is a cultural skill that values do not have.

>Students of culture keep looking for cultural values that will explain what is distinctive about the behavior of groups or societies, and neglect other distinctively cultural phenomena which offer greater promise of explaining patterns of action. p.4

Swidler is drawing a line here between VALUES/PREFERENCES and SKILLS/HABITS

So, for Parsons/Weber, where do skills and habits come in? What is their theory of practice? And if practice is absent, can it be reconciled with a value based understanding of things? And if so, how?

Swidler's critique of the protestant ethic is the same as mine - why keep doing the thing after you no longer value the action?

Swidler is concerned that our model of value->action does not fit with how individuals actually act. Here Swidler describes strategies of actions as bundles of actions that we see as possible in some set of time. What is a strategy of action? Swidler doesn't say so far.

She goes on again to stay that culture is not a unified system, but there are differences among individuals. Perhaps people will even come to value the ends for which their cultural tool kit suits them.

## Settled vs Unsettled
In settled times, culture and action are so linked that we are tempted to see values organizing patterns. In unsettled times people draw upon what they know to develop new sets of action. In some periods people change their mind about a bunch of things relatively quickly.
<def>Ideology for Swidler: Explicit, articulated, highly organized meaning systems</def>

Here action is more shaped by values? And perhaps less by common sense?
>Ideology may be thought of as a phase in the development of a system of cultural meaning. "Traditions" on the other hand, are articulated cultural beliefs and practices, but ones taken for granted so that they seem inevitable parts of life. p.8

For some an ideology, for others a tradition, the difference is at the individual level. In unsettled times ideology leads to new strategies of action where people end up reshaping the styles and skills with which they act.

In settled times, we imagine, there is a looser coupling between culture and action, as the meaning behind an action turns into a routine.
>In settled cultural periods, then, culture and social structure are simultaneously too fused and too disconnected for easy analysis.  p.10

Swidler also points to cultural lag, where people do not take advantage of new opportunities that align with their values because they would require them to abandon established ways of life. Swidler offers an image:

Swidler has three reorientations to cultural research:
1. Spend more time trying to understand how values are important. We can recognize the significance of values if we acknowledge that values do not shape action by defining its ends, but rather fine-tune the regulation of action within established ways of life.
2. Historical research on the connection between culture and social structure, and how it works in settled and unsettled periods. This is meant to give us a systematic view of the dynamic interactions between culture and social structure.
3. Understand a chunk of culture with its own history. "A crucial task for research is to understand how cultural capacities created in one historical context are reappropriated and altered in new circumstances."p.12

Old Notes:
Current definition of culture: “The publicly available symbolic forms through which people experience and express meaning” Symbolic forms are things like beliefs, ritual practices, art forms, ceremonies, language, and gossip

However Swidler focuses on the idea that culture is a “‘tool kit’ of symbols, stories, rituals, and world-views, which people may use in varying configurations to solve different kinds of problems.”

Really key point: “One can hardly pursue success in a world where the accepted skills, style, and informal know-how are unfamiliar. One does better to look for a line of action for which one already has the cultural equipment.”

“People construct “chains of action beginning with at least some pre-fabricated links. Culture influences action through the shape and organization of those links, not by determining the ends to which they are put.”

Culture provides a variety of known ways for one to act.

p.277: “Usually, we invoke culture to explain continuities in action in the face of structural changes."

Cultures effet on unsettled lives:
P.278 : “Periods of social transformation seem to provide simultaneously the best and the worst evidence for culture’s influence on social nation.” While some forms are jettisoned with ease, they are backed by other cultural norms

Differentiaties between “ideology” (a highly articulated self-conscious belief and ritual system) and traditions (articulated cultural believes and practices, but ones taken for granted so that they may seem inevitable parts of life). Say a wedding vs a justice of the peace. There is also “common sense” (a set of assumptions so unselfconscious as to seem a natural, transparent, undeniable part of the structure of the world)

“People developing new strategies of at ion depend on cultural models to learn styles of self, relationship, cooperation, authority and so forth.”

“Coherent idelologies emerge when new ways of organizing action are being developed.”

“Culture has independent causal influence in unsettled cultural periods because it makes possible new strategies of action—constructing entities that can act (esleves, families, corporations), shaping the styles and skills with which they act, and modeling forms of authority and cooperation. It is, however, the concrete situations in which these cultural models are enacted that determine which take root and thrive, and which wither and die.” p.2280

In settled lives there is a loose coupling between culture and action.

**COuld the loose coupling be a shift (perhaps generational) whiere ideology becomes tradition?)**
Ann’s difference: “settled cultures constrain action by providing a limited set of resources out of which individuals and groups construct strategies of action’

Swidler does a wonderful job in this paper bringing the focus of cultural action and social life back to the individual, and while the individual is heavily categorized, particularly in terms of whether they are settled or   unsettled, and whether a particular action is tradition, common sense, or ideology, it is difficult to understand how one person might be put into one of these categories in a away that’s meaningful.
