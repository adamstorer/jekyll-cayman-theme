## Introduction

Subjectivism (phenomenology) vs. Positivism (social physicis) is a false division. Why do we get there?

<def>Phenomenology from Bourdieu: Reflecs an experience which does not reflect itself. This brings light to the truth of an experience that is certain with respect to experience.</def>

But it cannot go beyond that because it does not think about the conditions of possibility of phenomenology itsel.f

<def>Objectivism from Bourdieu: Establishes objective regularities independent of individual consciousness and wills, introducing a discontinuity between theoreticl and practical knowledge.</def>

>Social science must not only, as objectivism would have it,
break with native experience and the native representation of that experience,
but also, by a second break, call into question the presuppositions inherent
in the position of the 'objective' observer who, seeking to interpret
practices, tends to bring into the object the principles of his relation to
the object, as is shown for example by the privileged status he gives to
communicative and epistemic functions, which inclines him to reduce
exchanges to pure symbolic exchanges. p.27

Scientific knowledge, then, is partially based on a privilege that scientists turn a blind eye to.
>The unanalysed element in every theoretical analysis (whether subjectivist
or objectivist) is the theorist's subjective relation to the social world and
the objective (social) relation presupposed by this subjective relation. p.29

## Objectification Objectified

We start with Saussure who really constructed objectives.
Saussure argues that communication is done not by speech but by language, a system of objective relations which makes possible both the production and decoding of discourse.

Speech seems to be the precondition of language. But to make language important, one "has to situate onself in the logical order of intelligibility." p.31

But what is the scientists relationship to the object (language?).

>This
presupposes that one momentarily relinquishes, and then tries to objectify,
the place designated in advance as that of the objective and objectifying
observer who, like a stage manager playing at will with the possibilities
offered by the objectifying instruments in order to bring the object closer
or move it further away, to enlarge or reduce it, imposes on the object
his own norms of construction, as if in a dream of power. p. 31

In other words, the researcher here is an ungrounded impartial spectator. When someone thinks about language, they think about it as a logic rather than a practice, but this is only a scholastic dichotomy.  Liebniz argues that thinking about speech an language, we isolate meaning in a way that doesn't make sense.


> Charles Bally pointed out that linguistic research takes
diffferent directions when dealing with the linguist's mother tongue or
with a foreign language, and he emphasized in particular the tendency
towards intellectualism entailed by apprehending language from the
standpoint of the listening rather than the speaking subject, that is, as a
means of decoding rather than a 'means of action and expression': 'The
listener is on the side of the language, it is with the language that he
interprets speech p.33

To remove yourself in your own research is to separate yourself from how you think about acting - Burawoy is very good in this sense of not falling into this trap. Or maybe he does? I'm not sure.

IN studies of kinship in anthropology, this is really an outsiders objective viewpoint, attempting to see how things are done without really understanding the part of the doing.
>The family tree, a spatial diagram that can be taken in at
a glance, uno intuitu and scanned indifferently in any direction from any
point, causes the complete network of kinship relations over several
generations to exist in the mode of temporal existence which is that of
theoretical obj ects, that is, tota simul, as a totality in simultaneity. It puts
on the same footing official relationships, which, for lack of regular
maintenance, ' tend to become what they are for the genealogist, that is,
theoretical relationships, like abandoned roads on an old map ; and practical
relationships which really function because they fulfil practical functions.
It thereby tends to conceal the fact that the logical relations of kinship,
which the structuralist tradition almost completely autonomizes with
respect to economic determinants, exist in practice only through and for
the official and unofficial uses made of them by agents whose inclination
to keep them in working order and to make them work more intensively
- hence, through constant use, ever more smoothly - rises with the degree
to which they actually or potentially fulfil useful functions, satisfying vital
material or symbolic interests. p. 35

THat is, there is always something obscuring the construct of the practice from the practice itself as it is done by the object.

In old anthropology, this distinction was felt in understanding the strict formalized rules of a culture and the norms within it. But this distinction is hard to disentangle.

Also, Wittgenstein's argument is that we may ask people for rules and they may give us answers, but if they are willing to withdraw or alter their answers then is it really a rule? What do we mean by rule if it is not a thing that people actually operate by.

That is, we slip from regularity to regulating.

## The Imaginary Anthropology of Subjectivism

Sartre sees action as an antecedent-less confrontation between the subject and the world. From Sartre:
>It is on the day tJiat we are able to conceive of
another state of affairs, that a new light is cast on our trouble and our
suffering and we decide that they are unbearable p.42

In fact, willing something in the world seems to be the only thing that matters.
>the Sartrian subject,
whether an individual or collective subject, can break out of the absolute
discontinuity of choices without past or future only by the free resolution
of a pledge and self-loyalty or by the free abdication of bad faith, the sole
foundations of the only two conceivable forms, authentic and inauthentic,
of constantia sibi. p. 43

But this discounts the role of the social world.

Many other thinkers, Nietzche, Durkheim, and Hegel follow in this footsteps of thinking about the mind as the place where people work on the world in a full sense.

What we really get from this is:
>subjectivism universalizes the experience that the
subject of theoretical discourse has of himself as a subject. p.46

That is, we must realize that the science of man forms "of man," who is the object and also the subject of this science.

>Thus the so-called 'rational actor' theory oscillates between the ultrafinalist
subjectivism of a consciousness 'without inertia'3 which creates the
meaning of the world de novo, at every moment, and which can fin?
continuity and constancy only in the faithfulness to oneself :vhereby It
'binds itself', like Ulysses sailing past the Sirens, and an mtellectual
determinism which, though it often defines itself in opposition to it, is
separated only by a few d 􀂢fferences in ph 􀌳asing fr<?m a mechani􀄜tic
determinism that reduces actlon to a mechanIcal reaction to mechanIcal
determinations and reduces economic agents to indiscernible particles
subjected to the laws of a mechanical equilibrium. p.47

So we also cannot say there is any kind of rational actor, as this is built from a notion of pure reason. All notions of science of man seem to end up relying on this.

>The 'rational actor' theory, which seeks the 'origin' of acts,
strictly economic or not, in an 'intention' of 'consciousness', is often
associated with a narrow conception of the 'rationality' of practices, an
economism which regards as rational (or, which amounts to the same thing
in this logic, as economic) those practices that are consciously oriented by
the pursuit of maximum (economic) profit at minimum (economic) cost. p.50

YOu lose something in the logic of actions when you think about them in only an academicized way.

## Structures, Habitus, Practices

To think of a theory of practice as practice, we must think of objects of knowledge as constructed, not passively recorded, and the principle of this construction is the system of structured, structuring dispositions.

*This is a leap, right, to say that thinking of how people make up practices requires you to think about the construction of the system of structured, structuring dispositions?*

This is the habitus, which is constitued in practice and oriented towards practical functions.
<def>Habitus: The system of structured, structuring disposition which is constituted in practice and oriented towards practical functions. p.52. Durable, transposable dispositions. Structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures. p53 </def>

*Is this really such a leap from Schutz, who thinks about action as practical action?*

A particular class of conditions produce habitus.
>Objectively 'regulated' and 'regular' without being
in any way the product of obedience to rules, they can be collectively
orchestrated without being the product of the organizing action of a
conductor p. 53

Habitus can have a strategic calculation, based on weighing the past effect into an expected objective. But these responses are defined by the way you think.

>Stimuli do not exist for practice in their objective truth,
as conditional, conventional triggers, acting only on condition that they
encounter agents conditioned to recognize them.2 The practical world that
is constituted in the relationship with the habitus, acting as a system of
cognitive and motivating structures, is a world of already realized ends
procedures to follow, paths to take - and of objects endowed with a
'permanent teleological character', in Husserl's phrase, tools or institutions. p.53

We have regularities that tend to appear as natural.

If we see people acting "rationally" it is because:
>the dispositions durably inculcated by the possibilities and
impossibilities, freedoms and necessities, opportunities and prohibitions
inscribed in the objective conditions (which science apprehends through
statistical regularities such as the probabilities objectively attached to a
group or class) generate dispositions objectively compatible with these
conditions and in a sense pre-adapted to their demand s. p.54

This tends to create a certain type of anticipation:
>Unlike scientific estimations, which are corrected after each experiment according
to rigorous rules of calculation, the anticipations of the habitus, practical
hypotheses based on past experience, give disproportionate weight to early
experiences p. 54

So, again:
>the structures characteri zing a determinate class of conditions
of existence produce the structures of the habitus, which in their turn are
the basis of the perception and appreciation of all subsequent experiences.

This habitus produces individual and collective practices, a product of history, it also creates history in accordance with its own history. SO external forces exert themselves on people, but they merge with the specific logics of the organisms that experience them.

We may see this as deterministic, but it is beyond that.
>Because the habitus is an
infinite capacity for generating products - thoughts, perceptions, expressions
and actions - whose limits are set by the historically and socially situated
conditions of Its production, the condItioned and conditional freedom it
provides is as remote from creation of unpredictable novelty as it is from
simple mechanical reproduction of the original conditioning p. 55

So, because of habitus, Bourdieu argues, we cannot see the development of something as the realization of an essence. After art develops (if art is the thing which is realizing an essence), which is made through all sorts of continuous redefinition, end with an idea that to us we perceive as unitary only because we see the thing in the same way as its most recent production.

>In short, being
the product of a particular class of objective regularities, the habitus tends
to genera􀆕e all the ' reasonable', 'common-sense',4 behaviours (and only
these) which are possIble within the limits of these regularities, and which
are likely to be positively sanctioned because they are objectively adjusted
to the logic characteristic of a particular field, whose objective future they
anticipate. At the same time, 'without violence, art or argument', it tends
to exclude all 'extravagances' ('not for the likes of us'), that is, all the
behaviours that would be negatively sanctioned because they are incompatible
with the objective conditions.

TO understand practice, we have to understand how individuals learned to think about things, in other words, by understanding how the habitus was constituted. This idea is in Durkheim partially.

From Durkheim:
>'In each one of us, in differing degrees, is contained the person we were
yesterday, and indeed, in the nature of things it is even true that our past
personae predominate in us, since the present is necessarily insignificant
when compared with the long period of the past because of which we have
emerged in the form we have today. It is just that we don't di rectly feel
the influence of these past selves precisely because they are so deeply
rooted within us. p.56

This means that shared meaning is based on shared history:
>In so far - and only in so far - as habitus are the incqrporation of the
same history, or more concretely, of the same history obje􀝝tified in habitus
and structures, the practices they generate are mutually intelligible and
immediately adjusted to the structures, and also objectively concerted and
endowed with an objective meaning that is at once unitary and systematic,
transcending subjective intentions and conscious projects, whether individual
or collective p. 58

There can then be a homogenizing of class habitus based on the shared experiences of the same group. IF people are from the same class, they have a somewhat shared habitus.

The relationship between clsas habitus and individual habitus is difficult. Class habitus is
>could be regarded as a subjective but non-i.ndividual sy􀅷tem of
internalized structures, common schemes of perceptIOn, conceptIOn and
action, which are the precondition of all objectification and apperception ;
and the objective co-ordination of practices and the sharing of a worldview
could be founded on the perfect impersonality and interchangeability
of singular practices and views.

But there is more than that, right? There is diversity within the group, because each individual system is a structural variant of others. There is not a shared set of dispositions because everyone moves a little bit from the main dispositions.

>The principle of the differences between individual habitus lies i􀄛 the
singularity of their social traject?rie􀅸, to which there corres!;,ond s􀍂nes of
chronologically ordered determmatIons that are mutually IrreduCible to
one another. p. 60

Early experiences are more important. Instead, people have similar views but attempt to preserve them by hanging out with people like them. We create a constant universe because the habitus wants to protect itself from experiencing something different.

>And once again it is the most paradoxical
property of the habitus, the unchosen principle of all 'choices', that yields
the solution to the paradox of the information needed in order to avoid
information. The schemes of perception and appreciation of the habitus
which are the basis of all the avoidance strategies are largely the product
of a non-conscious, unwilled avoidance, whether it results automatically
from the conditions of existence (for example, spatial segregation) or has
been produced by a strategic intention (such as avoidance of 'bad company'
or 'unsuitable books') originating from adults themselves formed in the
same conditions. p. 61

I'm not sure we need this, but it is actually kind of similar to why do liberals drink lattes.
>Thus, for example, in the interaction between two agents or
groups of agents endowed with the same habitus (say A and B), everything
takes place as if the actions of each of them (say al for A) were organized
by reference to the reactions which they call forth from any agent possessing
the same habitus (say bl for B). They therefore objectively imply anticipation
of the reaction which these reactions in turn call forth (a2, A's reaction to
bl). p.62

The habitus, the dispositions when shared between like people, generates the practices and actions that seem to have some kind of meaning. IT is a kind of false anticipation that is intelligible to people.

## Belief and Body

So how do we end up with practical sense? It is though a bodily involvement with the world
>particularly clear example of practical sense as a proleptic
adjustment to the demands of a field is what is called, in the language of
sport, a 'feel for the game'. This phrase (like 'investment sense', the art of
'anticipating' events, etc . ) gives a fairly accurate idea of the almost
miraculous encounter between the habitus and a field, between incorporated
history and an objectified history, which makes possible the near-perfect
anticipation of the future inscribed in all the concrete configurations on
the pitch or board. p. 66

To make sense of our own practical sense, Bourdieu bring sin a discussion of the field. IN a game, we see the field as an arbirtrary social construct with rules that given your history, you hav ea sense of how to play.

>By contrast, in the social fields,
which are the products of a long, slow process of autonomization, and
are therefore, so to speak, games 'in themselves' and not 'for themselves',
one does not embark on the game by a conscious act, one is born into
the game, with the game ; and the relation of investment, illusio, investment,
is made more total and unconditional by the fact that it is unaware of
what it is. p. 67

Think of another metaphor, when you learn a language, the earlier you learn it you not only speak it but you think in it.

For some reason practical faith plays a role in the field by sanctioning and debarring those who would destroy the game.

>but by so
arranging things, in practice, that the operations of selecting and shaping
new entrants (rites of passage, examinations, etc. ) are such as to obtain
from them that undisputed, pre-reflexive, naive, native compliance with
the fundamental presuppositions of the field which is the very definition
of doxa p.68

>Practical belief is not a 'state of mind', still less a kind of arbitrary
adherence to a set of instituted dogmas and doctrines ('beliefs'), but rather
a state of the body. Doxa is the relationship of immediate adherence that
is established in practice between a habitus and the field to which it is
attuned, the pre-verbal taking-for-granted of the world that flows from
practical sense. Enacted belief, instilled by the childhood learning that
treats the body as a living memory pad, an automaton that 'leads the mind
unconsciously along with it', and as a repository for the most precious
values, is the form par excellence of the 'blind or symbolic thought' p. 68

So you develop this habitus and then you enter a field in which the same habitus has defined the field. You can enter in and experience "doxa" in which there is an easy alignment between the habitus of the field and your own habitus.

>Practical sense, social necessity turned into nature, converted
into motor schemes and body automatisms, is what causes practices, in
and through what makes them obscure to the eyes of their producers, to
be sensible, that is, informed by a common sense. It is because agents
never know completely what they are doing that what they do has more
sense than they know.

Practical sense is doing things in a certain way automatically, a part of habitus that leads to acting effectively in a field.

>One could endlessly enumerate the values given
body, made body, by the hidden persuasion of an implicit pedagogy which
can instil a whole cosmology, through injunctions as insignificant as 'sit
up straight' or 'don't hold your knife i n your left hand', and inscribe the
most fundamental principles of the arbitrary content of a culture in
seemingly innocuous details of bearing or physical and verbal manners, so
putting them beyond the reach of consciousness and explicit statement.p.69

You can see a certain set of dispositions embodied in practice for a class with respect to ways of eating:
>First, in the use of
the mouth : a man should eat with his whole mouth, wholeheartedly, and
not, like women, just with the lips, that is, halfheartedly, with reservation
and restraint, but also with dissimulation p.70


>When the properties and movements of the body are socially qualified,
the most fundamental social choices are naturalized and the body, with its
properties and its movements, is constituted as an analogical operator
establishing all kinds of practical equivalences among the different divisions
of the social world - divisions between the sexes, between the age groups
and between the social classes - or, more precisely, among the meanings
and values associated with the individuals occupying practically equivalent
positions in the spaces defined by these divisions p. 71

This is part of the field metaphor, we are learning to play a game, to act in a certain way. We learn these things not through a conscious immitation as much as through unconscious...immitation.

>What is 'learned by body' is not something that one has, like knowledge
that can be brandished, but something that one is. p.73

There is also some sort of pedgagical instruction which transmits particular forms of practical mastery.

For Bourdieu there is some sense of imprinting that includes a level of depth.

>It is not hard to imagine the weight that the opposition between
masculinity and femininity must bring to bear on the construction of selfimage
and world-image when this opposition constitutes the fundamental
principle of division of the social and the symbolic world p. 78

There are some things which have a greater or a weaker effect on the construction of self image. Some that people cannot shake.

## The Logic of Practice

Is there some division between organizing consciousness and automatic behaviours? Remember, we must include time in the equation. And we must not think of the post-hoc meaning making as much as the thought at the time of action.

We think of timing in science, but this timing is not the timing of practice.

>For the analyst, time
disappears : not only because, as has often been repeated since Max Weber
pointed it out, arriving after the battle, the analyst cannot have any
uncertainty as to what can happen, but also because he has the time to
totalize, that is, to overcome the effects of time. Scientific practice is so
detemporalized that it tends to exclude even the idea of what it excludes.p.81

The scientific account of practice leaves something behind. While practice has a linear function, science seems to miss this. Practice ahs a logic which is not that of the logician.

>This
practical logic - practical in both senses - is able to organize all thoughts,
perceptions and actions by means of a few generative principles, which are
closely interrelated and constitute a practically integrated whole, only
because its whole economy, based on the principle of the economy of
logic, presupposes a sacrifice of rigour for the sake of simplicity and
generality and because it finds in 'poly thesis ' the conditions required for
successful use of polysemy. In other words, symbolic systems owe their
practical coherence that is , on the one hand, their unity and their
regularities, and on the other, their 'fuzziness' and their irregularities and
even incoherences, which are both equally necessary, being inscribed in
the logic of their genesis and functioning - to the fact that they are the
product of practices that can fulfil their practical functions only in so far
as they implement, in the practical state, principles that are not only
coherent - that is, capable of generating practices that are both intrinsically
coherent and compatible with the objective conditions - but also practical,
in the sense of convenient, that is, easy to master and use, because they
obey a 'poor' and economical logic p. 86

Practice allows for NOT putting things together conceptually. YOu simply do things.

>The universes of meaning corresponding to different universes of practice
are both self-enclosed - and therefore protected against logical control
through systematization - and objectively adjusted to all the others in so
far as they are loosely systematic products of a system of practically
integrated generative principles that function in the most diverse fields of
practice. p. 87

People do things and they have semi meaning, some things are meaningful some aren't.

>By inducing
an identity of reaction in a diversity of situations, impressing the same
posture on the body in different contexts, the practical schemes can produce
the equivalent of an act of generalization that cannot be accounted for
without recourse to concepts - and this despite the fact that the enacted,
unrepresented generality that arises from acting in a similar way in similar
circumstances, but without 'thinking, the similarity independently of the
Similar , as Plaget puts It, dispenses With all the operations required by the
construction of a concept.

The logic of practice is in total opposition to a logic of reflection. One does not think about the way one does things, they simply do things.

>The idea of practical logic, a 'logic in itself' , withoutt conscious reflection
or logical control, is a contradiction In terms, whIch defies logical logIC.
This paradoxical logic is th􀄡a of all Practice, or rather. of all practical sense.


## The Work of Time

What about the fact that practice is constructed over time?

>This is true of all practices which, like gift exchange
or the joust of honour, are defined, at least in the eyes of the agents, as
irreversible oriented sequences of relatively unpredictable acts. p. 98

>And one can construct a
relatively simple generative model which makes it possible to give an
account of the logic of practice, that is, to generate - on paper the
universe of practices (conducts of honour, acts of exchange) really observed,
which impress both by their inexhaustible diversity and their apparent
necessity, without resorting to I the imaginary 'file of prefabricated
representations', as J akobson (1 956) puts it, that would enable one to
'choose' the conduct appropriate to each situation. p.100

What Bourdieu presents is a decision tree.

>Practical logic, bast;cl on a system of objectively coherent
generative and organizing schemes, functioning in the practical state as an
often imprecise but systematic principle of selection, has neither the rigour
nor the constancy that characterize logical logic, which can deduce rational
action from the explicit, explicitly controlled and systematized principles
of an axiomatics (qualities which would also be those of practical logic if
it were deduced from the model constructed to account for it). This IS
why practical logic manifests itself in a kind of stylistic unity which,
though immediately perceptible, has none of the strict, regular coherence
of the concerted products of a plan p. 102


>It becomes clearer why that 'semi-learned' production, the rule, is the
obstacle par excellence to the construction of an adequate theory of practice.
By spuriously occupying the p lace of two fundamental notions, the
theoretical matrix and the practical matrix, it makes it impossible to raise
the question of their relationship. The abstract model that has to be
constructed (for example, to account for the practices of honour) is
completely valid only if it is presented for what it is, a theoretical artefact
totally alien to practice - although a rational pedagogy can make it serve
practical functions by enabling someone who possesses its practical
equivalent to really appropriate the p rinciples of his practice, either in
order to bring them to their full realization or in order to try to free
himself from them. p. 103

I guess the question is, right, when are these things combined into something meaningful? How do we make sense of the two together?

There is something about gift giving where you need to take time in between giving and recieving to make the whole thing intelligible to the actors, because otherwise it would be seen as ridiculous. Timing allows for some kind of strategy in the field.

>Thus time derives its efficacy from the state of the structure of relations
within which it comes into play ; which does not mean that the model of
this structure can leave it out of account. When the unfolding of the action
is heavily ritualized, as in the dialectic of offence (assault on h 'aram) and
vengeance, where failure to respond, even when presented as disdain, is
ruled out, there is still room for strategies that consist in playing with the
time, or rather the tempo, of the action, by delaying revenge so as to use
a capital of provocations received or conflicts suspended, with its charge
of potential revenge and conflict, as an instrument of power based on the
capacity to take the initiative in reopening or suspending hostilities. p. 106

There is some notion of structure which is called something like "native theory"
>The relationship between the objectivist model and the habitus, between
the theoretical schema and the scheme of practical sense (which is shadowed
by practical rules, partial and imperfect statements of the principles), is
thus complicated by a third term, the official norm and the native theory
which redouble at the level of discourse, and so reinforce, the repression
of the 'objective' (that is, objectivist) truth that is inscribed in the very
structure of practice and, as such, is part of the full truth of practice. p.107

>Thus objectivism falls short of objectivity by failing to integrate into its
account of reality the representation of reality against which it has had to
construct its 'objective' representation, but which, when it is backed by
the unanimity of the group, realizes the most indisputable form of
objectivity. p.110


## Symbolic Capital

This begins with a critique of Marx in which we realize that people used to think about exchange in different ways.

Symbolic capital is valid in a market, in places where things must seem somehow voluntary.
>􀂁conomic and. symbolic capital are so
mextncably mtertwmed that the display of matenal and symbolic strength
represented by prestigious affines is in itself likely to bring in material
profits, in a good-faith economy in which good repute constitues the best,
If not t􀂡e only, economic guarantee p. 119


>So it is by drawing up a comprehensive balance-sheet of symbolic profits,
without forgetting the undiffere ntiatedness of the symbolic and the material
components of a family's wealth, that it becomes possible to grasp the
economic rationality of conduct which economism dismisses as absurd.
For example, the decision to buy a second yoke of oxen after the harvest,
on the grounds that they are needed for treading out the grain - which is
a way of making it known that the crop has been plentiful - only to have
to sell them again for lack of fodder, before the autumn ploughing, when
they would technically be necessary, seems economically aberrant only if
one forgets all the material and symbolic profit accruing from this (albeit
fictitious) enhancement of the family's symbolic capital in the late-summer
period when marriages are negotiated p. 120

I think perhaps Symbolic capital is important here because it is an additional aspect which can be forgotten in objective/subjective studies of science through time. It is also taking into account rules and strategies as defined above, and this is essentially an extra dimension by which strategy plays out in fields.

## Modes of Domination

There is an economic logic, perhaps, everywhere. People may make decisions trying to maximize symbolic profit.

>But the existence of symbolic capital, that is, of 'material'
capital misrecognized and thus recognized, thou􀈀h it does not , inval,idate
the analogy between capital and enery , does rerr:I 􀃱 d us that sO􀃲lal s􀂴len􀈁e
is not a social physics; that the acts of cognltlon that are Imphe<:J m
misrecognition and recognition are part of social reality and,tha􀃰 the sO􀃳Ially
constituted subjectivity that produces them belongs to obJ􀂏 ctlve reahty. p. 122

It is important to realize that there is no separation between economic and non-economic thinking because we are always trying to maximize something. Basically, soft domination (symbolic?) occurs when people wish to exercise soem form of domination or exploitation in settings where direct domination is disapproved of.

>In short, in the absence of an officially declared and institutionally
guaranteed delegation, personal authority can only be lastingly maintained
through actions that reassert it p ractically through their compliance with
the values recognized by the group. I I The 'great' can least afford to take
liberties with the official norms and they have to pay for their outstanding
value with exemplary conformity to the values of the group. p. 129


>If it is true that symbolic violence is the gentle, disguised form which
violence takes . when overt violence is impossible, it is understandable that
symbolic forms of domination should have progressively withered away
as objective mechanisms came to be constituted which, in rendering the
work of euphemization superfluous, tended to produce the 'disenchanted'
dispositions that their development demanded. 1 8 It is equally clear why
the development of the capacity for subversion and critique that the most
brutal forms of 'economic' exploitation have aroused, and the uncovering
of the ideological and practical effects of the mechanisms ensuring the
reproduction of the relations of domination, should bring about a return
to modes of accumulation based On the conversion of economic capital
into symbolic capital, with all the forms of legitimizing redistribution,
public (,social' policies) and private (financing of 'disinterested' foundations,
donations to hospitals, academic and cultural institutions, etc.), through
which the dominant groups secure a capital of 'credit' which seems to owe
nothing to the logic of exploitation ; 1 9 or the thesaurization of luxury goods
attesting the taste and distinction of their possessor. p.133

## The Objectivity of the Subjective

The established order contribute to their own perpetuation through their existence.

>Social science has to
reintroduce into the full definition of the object the primary representations
of the object, which it first had to destroy in order to achieve the 'objective'
definition p. 135

There is a relationality here, we need to think about the relations of the object. This comes back to the false choice between social physics and phenomenology.

The objectivist vision extracts the objective truth of power relations, but stops thinking about the relations and the reasons why the class was constructed in the moment.

The class is constructed through a constant battle for symbolic capital. This is as true within class as it is between classes.

Since there is social differentation based on a quest for symbolic capital within the same group, as a group becomes more similar, their subjective distance grows. As a result, growing class conflict means less class struggle, since a growing class means a view of more differentiation between the classes.

This is because, in a way, the sybmolic struggle only occurs within their own neighborhood.

*But this drive comes out of nowhere. Why must we take it as such? Is this not a part of the durable disposition?*
>It is in the dialectic between class condltlOns and
'class sense', between the 'objective' conditions recorded In distributions
and the structuring dispositions, themselves structured by these conditions,
that is, in accordance with the distributions, that the continuous structure
of the distributions reappears, now transfigured and misrecognizable,
in the discontinuous structure of hierarchized life-styles and in the
representations and recognitions that arise from misrecognition of their objective truth. p. 140

I am not really interested in seeing these applied in the cases that Bourdieu has chosen.
