The German Ideology is where you should get an idea of Marx's idea of history.

The first page of this text shows that Marx is against an 'idealistic' notion of history, that is, where history happens in the realm of ideas, at the behest of philosophers.

### Ideology in General, German Ideology in Particular
German criticism is a wholly philosophical enterprise, never moving to the material. They are in the ideas of hegel, argue against hegel, but end again with hegels ideas, that is, idealism.

Marx argues the "Young Hegelians" consider "conceptions, thoughts, ideas...to which they attribute an independent existence, as the real chains of men" p.149.
The "Old Hegelians" called ideas the true bonds of human society.

The idea is that everything happens in your head, there is no material conditions of any import.
>It has not occured to any one of these philosophers to inquire into the connection of German philosophy with German reality" p. 149

Marx argues we can distinguish men in any way we want but
<def>How do men distinguish themselves?: BY producing their means of subsistence, they produce their actual material life, and in this way their material lives are different from one another</def>
The ways in which men subsist produce their material life.

As men work, they produce a division of labor, and this division of labor leads  to all sorts of differences, such as the separation of twon and country, and the conflict of those interests.

<def>First form of ownership: Tribal, living by hunting and fishing, almost no division of labour ins society, only in the family. Slavery is latent, with fathers/patriarchs ordering their family around</def>
<def>Second form of ownership: Ancient communal/State Ownership - the union of tribes into a city, with communally owned slaves</def>
In this second form, we see the complete development of a class difference between citizens and slaves.
<def>Third form of ownership: Feudal/Estate Property - Town and Country distinction, the producing class is the small peasantry and serfs vs the nobles</def>

Marx argues that throught this time, the production of conceptions of consciousness is interwoven with the ways that men reproduce their existence. Here we are ascending from earth to heaven, thinking about life through the lens of our material existence.


## How does history move through time?
<def>Premises of Historical Movement 1: men must be in a position to live in order to be able to make history - thus producing</def>
<def>Premises of Historical Movement 2: Satisfying some need leads to new needs - this production of new needs is the first historical act</def>
<def>Premises of Historical Movement 3: men remake men, such as in the family</def>

Given this, the production of live is inherently a social situation.

Eventually we get from these a division of labor, and then an unequal distribution of products.

But what would a universal intercousrse among men look like -
1. IT must be  world-historical, it cannot only happen on a local level.
2. The forces of intercourse themselves could nothave developed as universal power
3. Each extensions of intercouse would abolish local communism.

## Concerning the Production of consciousness

Eventually the world market becomes the alien power holding everyone. But the idea holds in measuring history even before this. We just have to start from material production in order to understand how we think about things. For some reason nobody ever thinks this way even though they should.

Marx then goes on for a while about how measuring world history is too often done simply by listening to gossip by people in a single country, and not by real research.

>HIstory is nothing but the succession of the separate generations, each of which exploit the materials, the capital funds, the productive forces handed down by it by all preceding generation, and thus, on the one hand, continues the traditional activity in completely changed circumstances, and, on the other, modifies the old circumstances with a completely changed activity. p.172

THis can be misinterpreted as history having some aim orr direction, but you can always look to the past and say history was leading ot this moment.

"The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas." p.172

"The class which has the means of material production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production" p.172

But each new idea has to give themselves a form of universality. Revolution appears as the whole mass of society rising up against the ruling class.

>This whole semblance, that the rule o f a certain class is only the
rule of certain ideas, comes to a natural end, of course, as soon as
class rule in general ceases to be the form in which society is organised,
that is to say, as soon as it is no longer necessary to represent
. a particular interest as general or the "general interest" as ruling. p.174

## The Real Basis of Ideology

Marx talks here about the separation of town and country as an example.

>This does not, however,
retard the class movement of the proletariat, because the proletarians
created by big industry assume leadership of this movement
and carry the whole mass along with them, and because the workers
excluded from big industry are placed by it in a still worse situation
than the workers in big industry itself. The countries in which
big industry is developed act in a similar manner upon the more or
less non-industrial countries, insofar as the latter are swept by universal
commerce into the universal competitive struggle.l
These different forms are just so many forms of the organisation
of labour, and hence of property. In each period a unification of the
existing - productive forces takes place, insofar as this has been rendered
necessary by needs. p.186

<def>What is the state?: The state is "nothing more than the form oof organization which the bourgeois necessarily adopt both for internal and external purposes, for the mutual guarantee of their propetry and interests." p.187 </def>


## communism
Communism subjugates all of the alien powers that man makes to the will of the united individuals.
