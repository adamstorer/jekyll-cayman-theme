title:  "Goldberg et. al - What does it Mean to Span Cultural Boundaries?"

Abstract: "We propose a synthesis of two lines of sociological research on boundary spanning in cultural production and consumption. One, research on cultural omnivorousness, analyzes choice by heterogeneous audiences facing an array of crisp cultural offerings. The other, research on categories in markets, analyzes reactions by homogeneous audiences to objects that vary in the degree to which they conform to categorical codes. We develop a model of heterogeneous audiences evaluating objects that vary in typicality. This allows consideration of orientations on two dimensions of cultural preference: variety and typicality. We propose a novel analytic framework to map consumption behavior in these two dimensions. We argue that one audience type, those who value variety and typicality, are especially resistant to objects that span boundaries. We test this argument in an analysis of two large-scale datasets of reviews of films and restaurants."

We argue that one audience type, those who value variety and typicality, are especially resistant to objects that span boundaries.

We think of categorical boundaries as symbolic distinctions. Once we have some idea of boundaries, we often move to thinking about boundary spanning. Novel combinations of boundaries and codes can recieve reproach or enthusiasm, but for novelty to exist there must be some audiences tolerant of change. Who are these audiences?

This is an interesting take on boundaries, especially in reference to Gieryn's "not real" sense of them. That is, for Gieryn it wouldn't be about WHO is accepting the new category but HOW the new category is being discussed.

But for Goldberg, mayb ethere are individuals who do boundary spanning. There are some high status omnivorous individuals?
<def>What are the two types of Boundary Spanning for Goldberg: Variety - a combination of different practices, and atypicality - cultural practices that defy conventional categorical boudnaries.</def>

The Goldberg style argument is that there are certain individuals who have tastes for either variety or atypicality.

But of course it must be more complex than "some people have tastes for one or the other." But regardless, these two types of spanning are an interesting phenomenological distinction.

But Goldberg runs with it, putting these tastes on two axes, and naming the people on different axes.

People who don't like boundary spanning are different.
Those who like variety but do not like to defy convention may dislike some things.

>To summarize, we argue that the effect of
a taste for variety on the appeal of boundaryspanning
(atypical) objects runs opposite to
what research on the omnivore thesis tends to
assume

H1 - Appreciation for boundary-spanning atypical objects decreases with a taste for variety, once one accounts for taste for atypicality.
H2 - Compared to other audience types, poly-purists are most likely to reject boundary-spanning objects.

Atypicality is created by the same thing being labeled by multiple genres. For instance, a horror drama comedy is more atypical than a drama.
