Schutz begins by discussing Whitehead's ideas about things and thought. Things are not things! They are thought objects:
>It is a thought object, a construct of a highly complicated nature, involving not only particular forms of time-successions in order to constitute it as an object of one single sense, say of sight, and of space relations in order to constitute it as a sense-object of several senses, say of sight and touch, but also a contribution of imagination of hypothetical sense presentations in order to complete it p.1

Whitehead has something in mind here with many differnet thinkers:
>All our knowledge of the world, in common-sense as well as in scientific thinking, involves constructs, namely, a set of abstractions, generaliza- tions, formalizations, idealizations specific to the respective level of thought organization. Strictly speaking, there are no such things as facts, pure and simple. All facts are from the outset facts selected from a universal context by the activities of our mind. They are, therefore, always interpreted facts, namely, either facts looked at as detached from their context by an artificial abstraction or facts considered in their particular setting. In either case they carry along their interpretational inner and outer horizon. This does not mean that, in daily life or in science, we are unable to grasp the reality of the world. It just means that we grasp merely certain aspects of it, namely those which are relevant to us either for carrying on our business of living or from the point of view of a body of accepted rules of procedure of thinking called the method of science. p.2-3

This is kind of similar to Parsons. The idea is that the things we percieve of facts are relevant for us and may be percieved differnetly by different people.

## Constructs of Social Science
In this view all scientific constructs are meant to supersede common sense. In other words, you see this as a chair but I see it as, say, a set of molecules etc.
>It is up to the natural scientists to determine which sector of the universe of nature, which facts and events therein, and which aspects of such facts and events are topically and interpretationally relevant to their specific purpose p.3

For social science this is quite different.
>the social world, is not principally unstructurized. It has a particular meaning and relevance structure for the human beings living, thinking, and acting therein. They have preselected and preinterpreted this world by a series of common-sense constructs of the reality of daily life and it is these thought objects which determine their behavior, define the goal of their action, the means avail- able for attaining them-in brief, which help them to find their bearing within their natural and socio-cultural environment and to come to terms with it. The thought objects constructed by the social scientists refer to and are founded upon the thought objects constructed by the common-sense thought of man living his everyday life among his fellowmen.

In other words, social scientists make sense of how people make sense of the world. But people aren't sure how to methodologically make sense of how people make sense. Does the scientific method go out the window? Are people just another unit of anlaysis, no different form a particle.

Man every day is forced to focus on specific things based on a biographically detrmined situation.


## The Intersubjective Character of Common-sense knowledge

We do not operate alone! Our world is intersubjective because people act on the world together through some common influence.

>It is a world of culture because, from the outset, the world of everyday life is a universe of significance to us, that is a texture of meaning which we have to interpret in order to find our bearings within it and to come to terms with it. This texture of meaning, however-and this distinguishes the realm of culture from that of nature-originates in and has been instituted by human ac- tions, our own and our fellowmen's, contemporaries and predecessors. All cultural objects-tools, symbols, language systems, works of art, social institutions, etc.-point back by their very origin and meaning to the activities of human subjects p.7

There are three issues with socialization of knowledge:
1. Reciprocity of perpectives or the the structural socialization of knowledge. - The same object may seem the same to others or as different to others. Standpoints with different histories lead to a vision of the same things as somehow different. But we also assume any differences in view are irrelevant until they aren't.

>It is obvious that both idealizations, that of the interchangeability of the standpoints and that of the congruency of relevances-both together con- stituting the general thesis of reciprocal perspectives-are typifying constructs of objects of thought which supersede the thought objects of my and my fellowman's private experience. p.8

2. The social origin of knowledge or the genetic socialization of knowledge - only a small portion of knowledge comes from direct experience. knowledge is shared and handed down. Knowledge is transferred in many ways but mostly through vocabulary.
3. The social distribution of knowledge  - knowledge is socially distributed,
>Not only what an individual knows differs from what his neighbor knows, but also how both know the "same" facts. Knowledge has manifold degrees of clarity, distinctness, precision, and familiarity. To take as an example William James'28 well known distinction between "knowledge of acquaintance" and "knowledge-about" it is obvious that many things are known to me just in the dumb way of mere acquaintance, whereas you have knowledge "about" what makes them what they are and vice versa. I am an "expert" in a small field and "layman" in many others and so are you. p.10

## The structure of the Social World
We are in the world in a structured, for instance by who we can and can not communicate with. WE have certain face to face conversations with some poeple and not with others.

We also make assumptions based on this structure. WE assume a post manw ill deliver our mail and we expect a person to think in a particular way.
>The more anonymous the typifying con- struct is, the more detached is it from the uniqueness of the individual fellowman involved, the fewer aspects also of his personality and behavior pattern enter the typification as being relevant for the purpose at hand, for the sake of which the type has been constructed. If we distinguish between (subjective) personal types and (objective) course-of-action types we may say that increasing anonymization of the construct leads to the superseding of the former by the latter. In complete anonymization the individuals are supposed to be interchangeable and the course-of-action type refers to the behavior of "whomsoever" acting in the way defined as typical by the construct.p.13

We can never grasp the individual uniqueness of another person. However we understand a generlizaed other and have things like social functions and social concepts.
>But this is merely half the story. My constructing the other as a partial self, as the performer of typical roles or functions has a corollary in the process of self-typification which takes place if I enter into interaction with him. I am not involved in such a relationship with my total personality but merely with certain layers of it. In defining the role of the other I am assuming a role myself. In typifying the other's behavior I am typifying my own, which is interrelated with his, transforming myself into a pas- senger, consumer, taxpayer, reader, bystander, etc. p.14

>the pattern of typical constructs is frequently institutionalized as a standard of be- havior, warranted by traditional and habitual mores and sometimes by specific means of so-called social control, such as the legal order. p.14


## Course of action types and personal types
1. Action, project, motive.
Action - human conduct devised by the actor in advance. This can sometimes be in the form of a rational action or in terms of a rule of thumb habit type deal or smethign in between.
WE can make sense of a person's project and motive.

Motive can mean two things, the desired outcome and also the reasons that motivate a person. The difference is in-order-to motivves and because-motives.

2. Social Interaction
Social interactions contain the other and the action. Sometimes there is a reciprocity of motives.
Even the same end outcome can mean something different for different people in the same interaction.

>actor. Thus, the postulate of the "subjective interpretation of meaning," as the unfortunate term goes, is not a particularity of Max Weber's4' sociology or of the methodology of the social sciences in general but a principle of constructing course-of-action types in common-sense experience. p.19

3. The Observer
There is a special case where a person watches what's happening. Here the person has a chance to try and understand the motives of others - this is what the social scientist can look like.


## Rational Action

Really what we are looking for is a distinction between what is seen as sensible, reasonable or rational behavior.

>Sensible behavior, however, does not presuppose that the actor is guided by insight into his motives and the means-ends context. A strong emotional reaction against an offender might be sensible and refraining from it foolish. If an action seems to be sensible to the observer and is, in addition, supposed to spring from a judicious choice among different courses of action, we may call it reasonable even if such action follows traditional or habitual patterns just taken for granted. Rational action, however, presupposes that the actor has clear and distinct insight p.21

Interpreting other people's actions within this framework is quite difficult, because you may end up imposing an explanation that was not there.

If one makes a decision based on rationality the actor must take each course of action and make the following determinations:
1. One considers that the action starts in a precise state of affairs within a physical socio-cultural environment.
2. One considers the desired end point and one might have to understand the different types of ends that gets there. In other words, there are primary but also secondary results of my action.
3. Of the means one has to get from the starting point to the ends. And the possible loss from employing these means in some other way.

This gets more complicated the more you consider individuals.

But individuals from the same group often have a relatively similar understanding of how the world works which allows them to work together.


## Constructs of Thought Objects

1. Subjective Interpretation
>In the following
pages we take the position that the social sciences have to deal with
human conduct and its common-sense interpretation in the social reality,
involving the analysis of the whole system of projects and motives, of
relevances and constructs dealt with in the preceding sections. Such an
analysis refers by necessity to the subjective point of view, namely, to the
interpretation of the action and its settings in terms of the actor. Since this
postulate of the subjective interpretation is, as we have seen, a general
principle of constructing course-of-action types in common-sense experience,
any social science aspiring to grasp "social reality" has to adopt this
principle also. p.27

How can we grasp meaning subjectively, and present it objectively. Doesn't this seem difficult?

2. The social scientist as a disinterested observer.

This is how one gets objectivity, you are supposed to be disinterested.

3. Differences between common-sense and scientific consructs of action patterns
Common sense constructs take stock of socially derived knowledge and understand how it is distributed, in order to make sense of some sort of more abstract typifying construct.

>accessible. Yet both, participants
and observer, form their common-sense constructs relatively to their
biographical situation. In either case these constructs have a particular
place within the chain of motives originating in the biographically determined
hierarchy of the constructor's plan p.30

The social scientiests are supposed to be disinterested, removed from their context and attached to others to bring objectivity out of subjectivity. Scientiic knowledge replaces biographical context.

4. Scientific Models

One still makes models, as they do in common sense interpertation. But modelling a situation "one does this when they want this" removes them from their biographical context. And this is bullshit. Pure rational actions and measures of them are bs . Schutz likens this to a puppet show.

5. A few postulations of how to really do social science
1. Logical consistency - the constructs the sicentists derive should be logically consistent.
2. Subjective Interpretation - What is the model of individuals subjectivity? What are the typical contents to explain the observed facts.
3. Adequacy - Would the actor understand the motives that the scientist gives it?

<sum>Schutz is basically writing a manifesto for how sociology should be done. We must understand actors as complex characters, with their own unique perspectives, but also as a group of actors who share some common world that they all act on in different ways. People act in the world and have some motivation for doing so, and it is the job of the social scientist to make sense of that action.  However we have to be careful not to abstract away a person's context, or to assume rationality. Context effects the way people work together, and there are different ways in which individuals choose between potential actions, and rationality is only one part of the equation.</sum>
