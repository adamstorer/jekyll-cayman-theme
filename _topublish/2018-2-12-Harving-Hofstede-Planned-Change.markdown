Abstract: "This paper relates national culture differences to organizational change. More specifically, the influence of culture on both the reasons that people have to resist change and the strategies that can be distinguished to implement change is systematically examined. Countries are shown to differ considerably in both their resistance to change and the type of change strategies that would be preferred. The paper further explores the cultural connotations of one specific organizational change strategy: organization development. A final section takes up the implication of cultural differences for change agents working in a culture different from their own."

>This paper relates national culture differences to organizational change. More specifically, the influence of culture on both the reasons that people have to resist change and the strategies that can be distinguished to implement change is systematically examined. Countries are shown to differ considerably in both their resistance to change and the type of change strategies that would be preferred. The paper further explores the cultural connotations of one specific organizational change strategy: organization development. A final section takes up the implication of cultural differences for change agents working in a culture different from their own.

People make organizations but they are hard to control. Organizations change when they should not and do not change whent hey should. How do you direct organization change?

One aspect that determines change is the national culture.

## Contingency, Choice, and Cullture: A model
There are three  influences on orgs: contingency, choice and culture.

Contingency theories talk about th eimportance of circumstances in what people are doing.

In another aspect, we look at strategic choice, in which managers make choices, there is not just an environment led determination.
>There are a number of assumptions in this approach that oversimplify reality,
· such as, managers .. make decisions, all organizational decisions are made by
managers, managers are autonomous in making these decisions, and employees
carry out decisions by managers. As anybody with any organizational
experience should know, none of these assumptions is fully true. p. 300

But organizations are different in different parts o the world. This may be because there are different idetainal systems (different shared systems) or different adaptive saystems (total ways of life).

## Dimensions of National Cultures

Business school people like to draw on different dimensions of culture. People surveyed IBM subsidiaries in 72 countries to make sense of culture. They got
1. Power Distance - Degree of inequality among people that they consider normal.
2. Individualism - The degree to which people like to act in groups.
3. Masculinity - The degree to which assertiveness performance success and competition are importance.
4. Uncertainty Avoidance - The degree to which people in a country prefer structured over unstructured situations.

Drawing on cluster analysis from the IBM dataset, we see different countries cluster together along these scores, and there is some regionality to what's goin gon.

The clusters are pretty striking and show people thinka bout things in different ways.

## Organizational ChangeL Origins of Resistance
1. What reasons do people have to resist change?
2. What straegies can be didistinguished to implement change?

Resistance, any conduct that serves to maintain the status quo, has a few factors. People get stuck into habits and prefer not to change. Also, people build causal maps and have a hard time changing them. People may not take in new information that is different from the causal map.

People may also be concrened about future compeotence, fear the loss of face, or be tied to group neorm.s

## National Culture and Resistance to Change
HOw does national culture play a role?
>Different cultures hold different beliefs abouf the ability of people to control
their environment.. In cultures where people see themselves· as subjugated to
developments in their environment-which .are seen as quasi-autonomotisplanned,
pr.oactive change .will not be considered. In cultures where people
believe in the role of free win and 􀃦f dominance over their environment, change
will be seen · as both ,pos􀃧ible. and· natural. p.312

FOr instance, people may get stuck in a certain way because of uncertainty avoidance. Fears of future competence are important for those with high inequality or those who work as groups.

Essentially, each type of resistance to change is tied to a set of national culture ideas.

>Resistance because of loss of status or power will obviously be stronger in
cultures with a larger power distance. In such cultures having power is more
important, and privileges and status symbols are both expected and popular;
so if you lose power you are also likely to lose the accompanying privileges
and status symbols.
Resistance because of loss of face is more likely to occur in collectivist
societies as the issue of "face" is more important in these societies. Face can
be seen as the quality of a person's relationship with his or her social
environment, which is more important when the society is more tightly knit p. 315

# Change Strategies
The same can be said abou change strategies..
There are a few change strategies:
1. Power
2. Manipualtion
3. Consultation
4. Participation

National cultures also deal with different change strategies.
>Further, in low power-distance countries managers are more satisfied with
participative superiors and in high power-distance countries managers are more
satisfied with directive or persuasive superiors. So we would expect more
participative strategies in low power-distance countries and more power: and
manipulation/ persuasion strategies in high power-distance countries.
Subordinates in low power-distance countries prefer managers' decisionmaking
style to be centered on consultative give-and-take. In high powerdistance
countries subordinates preference for manager's decision-making style
is polarized between autocratic-paternalistic and majority rule, that is, a
democratic manager. p. 324
