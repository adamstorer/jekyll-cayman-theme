Abstract: "Occupations often have been defined as belonging to a particular class of work, linked to a single occupational rhetoric. In contrast, I argue here that most occupations are segmented in terms of divisions among workers, among work tasks, and among occupational identities. I present evidence from an ethnographic study of restaurant cooks to demonstrate that workers rely on a variety of occupational rhetorics as resources to define their work and their identity. I claim that cooks draw on the alternative rhetorics of profession, art, business, and labor to shape how they think of themselves as workers. The paper shows that occupational identity is socially, temporally, and spatially situated, raising the question of when particular rhetorical strategies will be relied upon."

>Occupations often have been defined as belonging to a particular class of work, linked to a single occupational rhetoric. In contrast, I argue here that most occupations are segmented in terms of divisions among workers, among work tasks, and among occupational identities. I present evidence from an ethnographic study of restaurant cooks to demonstrate that workers rely on a variety of occupational rhetorics as resources to define their work and their identity. I claim that cooks draw on the alternative rhetorics of profession, art, business, and labor to shape how they think of themselves as workers. The paper shows that occupational identity is socially, temporally, and spatially situated, raising the question of when particular rhetorical strategies will be relied upon.

One of the things that interests me about this article is that there is some notion of "rhetorics as resource" which is something akin to the toolkit notion of culture. We've been running into different notions of what culture is, but mostly a Parsonian view so far. This makes sense because Fine wrote this article in 1996, and has a somewhat different agenda than others.

People justify and think about their work when describing it to others in different ways. If people do it in the same way along an occupation, one might be able to say that there is something called an occupational identity.

>Typically, occupational identity is seen as a closely linked set of images that connects one to an unambiguous work world. While other self-schemas may apply to other spheres of life (e.g., family, leisure), a dominant schema organizes how one places oneself in light of a single set of occupational standards. Such a perspective, emphasizing a dominant occupational "character of mind" does not do justice to the diversities of work and its interpretations (Dornbusch and Scott, 1975). p.3

We think of occupations as having an essence, but people are different! And there are lots of different bundles of job characteristics for people to draw upon. Attorneys do different types of work, and can draw on common, uncommon, or a mix of characteristics.

>Few occupations have a single rhetorical stance, but, rather, occupational rhetorics are employed strategically. Perhaps more significantly, varying images of work may be presented on different occasions to exemplify a "situated identity" p.4

Even within a day, workers engage in tasks. So how could there be a single orientation? There is so much potential diversity. But then again, to roll these things up and to see general effects, that is, to leave occupational identities packed up, is to see the relative similarity, rather than to produce a completely differentiated mass.

## Cooks

Fine looks at cooks to make sense of this tension between occupational identity and diverse tasks. Looked at four restuarants, over 100 ays. There is a haute french cuisine, a continental style restaurant, a stakehouse, and a hotel restuarants. Because none of them are super fancy, they might see themselves as potentially more diverse. People made sense of their different professions.

Some cooks claim to have something like professional knowledge. What we see is that people rely on different rhetorics at difernet times depending on what is asked of them them.

>In practice, workers use images and typifications when and if they seem appropriate: the bricolage of identity work. Most occupations incorporate diverse tasks that have more or less creativity, autonomy, boredom, and goal- directedness. Each task or set of tasks conveys self-images and implications for identity-implications that differ among groups and individuals. p.24
