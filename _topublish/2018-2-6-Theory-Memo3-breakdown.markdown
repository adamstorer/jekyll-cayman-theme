Review for Meeting 3
# Gramsci
1. There is a main group and a subaltern group. How do subaltern groups become dominant?
2. Something like - since one must rule over all, one must not have a class background but a unity background.
3. War of Position vs War of Manouvre and Passive Revolution
4. Passive Revolution isone in which I think, the main economic structures remain intact.
- A war of position is one in which people seek to gain power among the current system, war of maneouvre is outright revolution.
5. Machiavelli and Marx - There is a political aspect to revolution. It is almost something autonomous.
6. In revolution we have a moment where we understand our "Marxist" type settings, then we make sense of the political forces moving people, and then one must pander politics.
7. One should rmeember that politics and class are not necessarily related. The ruling class can take on the arguments of the non-ruling class.
8. In a revolutionary force and a repressive force fighting against each other, we can end up with Caesarism, where a different third force intervenes. This is a charismatic leader. Caesarism can be progressive or reactionary.
9. Even with some revolutions, you do not get a true transition. The dominant class can give up a lot and remian in power.
10. This is because we have a lot of wars of position.
11.

# Lukacs
1. People's own labor becomes a commodity to them.
1a. Social Relations become commodity relations through work.
2. Work is rationalised - people and social relatins are turned into numbers.
2a. It is no longer an organic unity in the product. It is a rational calculation with special governing laws.
2b. As the product is fragmented (no unity) then the worker is fragmented as well, because it is there relations that create the product.
3. The atomisation, fragmentation of the individual is a necessary part of capitalism.
4. In a capitalist society, this fragmentation is everywhere, beyond just commodity relations.
5. In law, unitary qualitative actions are broken down systematically.
> It is evident that the whole structure of capitalist production rests on the interaction between a necessity subject to strict laws in all isolated phenomena and the relative irrationality of the total process.
6. Our current studies cannot see this because we are specialzied and cannot see the whole. We instead stamp out the things we can't make sense of.

# Marcuse
1. Capitalism has produced bad things through its particular rationality - socially necessary but painful work, free competition among unequal subjects, etc.
2. There are new possibilities because of our productive powers. We could free people from work.
3. But Capitalism has given us "false needs" which make it imposssible for us to free ourselves.
4. False needs are "superimposed upon the individual by particular social interests in his repression"
5. How do we know our real needs? If you are being indoctrinated and manipulated by capitalists interests, you cannot really know what you really want.
6. But to liberate yourself, you must realize that you are being repressed with false needs.
7. But again this is difficult because at the moment the inner space is consumed by capitalism.
8. So, people ahve one dimensional thought
>Thus emerges a pattern of one-dimensional thought and behavior in which ideas, aspirations, and objectives that, by their content, transcend the established universe of discourse and action are either repelled or reduced to terms of this universe. They are redefined by the rationality of the given system and of its quantitative extension.

# Habermas -Public Sphere
1. There used to be a pubic sphere - a discursive arena in modern societies where private persons discuss matters of common concern.
2. It was meant to make the state more public.
3. As the masses become involved, public debate turns to concern for private interests.
4. We see the distance between the ideal and actual in terms of the public sphere.

# Habermas - Communicative Action
1. Weber thought we were all moving towards Modernity.
2. That is, the system ends up in this place where everything is integrated into all spheres.
3. In the end, the purposeful rational ends up everywhere.
4. FOr Marx, there is also this notion of system showing up in the individual.
5. Marx thinks we just have a class view.
6. Realm of Necessity is thought of as system and realm of freedom is lifeworld, the notion that you can break out of a system and get a lifeworld is a different one. For Marx system and lifeworld are too closely integrated.
7. YOu might get this theory of reification and seeing everything in terms of commodities, but this is very specific and not necessary.
8. Marx failed for three reasons.
8a. Government INterventionism
8b. Mass Democracy - There is a tension between money and power and one cannot ignore one of them. THese are the two systems.
8c. Welfare State - We get a welfare state where different spheres of the lifeworld are redefined with respect to the two systems, capitalism and democracy.
9. What really makes sense in late capitalism is System, Lifeworld and "modernity."
10. Colonization of the lifeworld by system can only take place when "exchange relations between the subsystems and the lifeworld are regulated through differentiated roles..the abstractions that make labor power available are tolerated by those affected...where people think of all aspects of the world in terms of consumer and client.
11. In general, how many subsystems operate under the logic of the system.
12. Critical theory must answer what happens when communicative action is replaced by media steered interaction (money and power).
13. We must further understand the differentiation of the lifeworld, how action systems work, and didifferentaiton processes which bring the complex lifeworld into the view of the system.

# Althusser - Contradiction and Overdetermination
1. There is a structure, an economic base based on the forces of production and relations of production.
2. Structure has some contradiction within it, and int he last instance action is the result of structure.
3. There is also the Superstructure - state, legal, political and ideological forms.
4. Superstructures have relative autonomy.
5. In guiding revolution and what not - there is a contradiction and determination based on structure, which is standard marx, but there is also a lot of other stuff going on, which aslo determines how the contradiction will be dealt with. This is the overdetermination.

# Althusser - Ideological State Apparatuses
1. There is still an infrastructure, or structure as above.
2. There is also a superstructure, and this has two levels.
2a. Politico-Legal
2b. Ideology
3. Politico-legal is really the repressive one
4. Ideology creates a kind of consent that is necessary for the reproduction of labor power. In fact, ideology is necessary for the whole hting.
4a. Most government agencies have a repressive and an ideological branch, it is just a question of how the two are mixed up.
4b. Everything is ideological, including churches and schools.
4c. These are state because a classs must have power over others by operating on the way they think.
5. The most necessary things to create good aspects of capitalism? Good subjects, right? That means learning in school, the place where we get all of our ideas.

# Laclau and Mouffe - Hegemony and Socialist Strategy
1. I think these guys are really trying to restructure Marx by thinking about Hegeomny and class structure in a different way.
2. Hegemony allows us to think about lcass alliances, so that we can get ruling of the working class over all classes. (kind of)
3. In the end what we get is articulation and discourse.
3a. There are competing discursive formations which attempt to put some logical coherence into the world.
3b. Everythign is really a discursive practice.
4. Hegemony then, is to articulate many elements of social life into a single discourse.
5. Hegemony takes place when there are antagonistic forces and there is an instability in which there are different defintions possible.
6. This type of work can be there without any class alliance.
