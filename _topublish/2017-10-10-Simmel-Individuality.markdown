# How Society is Possible
Kant takes nature as possible by considering the representations of nature. Things What if we did the same for society?


wehave individuals who seem isolated from one another, and we must make sense of the unity through categorization. However, the actors make society, it needs no observer to make it. People make connections in ways that natural elements do not.

>This does not mean, of course, that each member of a society
is conscious of such an abstract notion of unity. It means that he
is absorbed in innumerable, specific relations and in the feeling
and the knowledge of determining others and of being determined
by them. p7

How do we know what the products of "sociation" are?

We make some assumptions about people without knowing for sure exactly what's going on. We assume based on ourselves:
>Every member of a group which is held together by
some common occupation or interest sees every other member not
just empirically, but on the basis of an aprioric principle which the
group imposes on everyone of its participants. Among officers,
church members, employees, scholars, or members of a family,
every member regards the other with the unquestioned assumption
that he is a member of "my group." p. 11

In other words, when we see an individual we impute group level characteristics. But this is essentially a distortion of that other individual. So,

>The distortions derive from all these a
priori, operative categories: from the individual's type as man,
from the idea of his perfection, and from the general society to
which he belongs. p.12

We use social categories but also some category of individual when understanding each other. That is, the individual is imputed based on social categories, but we also assume each person is unique in some way.

>the way in which he is sociated is determined
or codetermined by the way in which he is not...This extrasocial nature-a man's temperament,
fate, interests, worth as a personality-gives a certain
nuance to the picture formed by all who meet him. It intermixes
his social picture with non-social imponderables-however little
they may change his dominant activities as a bureaucrat or businessman
or officer. p.13

Different people move between the poles of totally social (a priest operating as a priest is not thought of by his individual personality) and the individual (a person at a market is expressing their will without any concern for the social)

</def>What is a society for Simmel?: A society is a structure which consists of beings who stand inside and outside of it at the same time</def>

>The question has
even been raised as to whether the individual is anything more
than a vessel in which elements existing before him are mixed in
varying measures. For even if these elements ultimately are produced
by the individual himself, his contribution is only minimal;
only as individuals converge in species and society do the
factors arise whose synthesis results in any discernible degree of
individuality. On the other hand, we see ourselves as members of
society. In this capacity we depend on it. By our life and its meaning
and purpose, we are as inextricably woven into society, as a
synchronic, coexisting phenomenon, as we are, as products, into
diachronic, successive society. p.16


We can try and separate society from the individual but the individual makes up all of the idiosyncratic data that constitutes society.

Individuals are directed by society to certain destinies.
>In the same way, the apriority of causality as a determining
precondition of cognition depends neither on its conscious
formulation in specific concepts nor on the behavior of reality,
as we grasp it psychologically, in accord or discord with it. For our
cognition is based on the premise of a pre-established harmony
that exists between our psychological energies, however individualized
they may be, and external, objective existence. This
existence always remains immediate, no matter how many attempts
there have been to show, metaphysically or psychologically,
that it is the intellect's own product. In a similar fashion, social life
presupposes an unquestionable harmony between the individual
and society as a whole. p.20

<def>How does the concept of a vocation fit into Simmel's understanding of the relationship between the individual and society?: The more highly developed concept of vocation refers to a particular phenomenon; On the one hand, society within itself produces and offers to the individual a place which-however different in content and delimitation it may be from other places-can be filled by many individuals, and which is, for this reason, something anonymous, as it were. On the other hand, this place, in spite of its general character, is nevertheless taken by the individual on the basis of an inner calling, a qualification felt to be intimately personal. For such a thing as vocation to be possible, there must exist that harmony, whatever its origin, between the structure and development of society, and individual qualities and impulses. p.21</def>
