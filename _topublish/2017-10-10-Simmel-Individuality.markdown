# How Society is Possible
Kant takes nature as possible by considering the representations of nature. Things What if we did the same for society?


wehave individuals who seem isolated from one another, and we must make sense of the unity through categorization. However, the actors make society, it needs no observer to make it. People make connections in ways that natural elements do not.

>This does not mean, of course, that each member of a society
is conscious of such an abstract notion of unity. It means that he
is absorbed in innumerable, specific relations and in the feeling
and the knowledge of determining others and of being determined
by them. p7

How do we know what the products of "sociation" are?

We make some assumptions about people without knowing for sure exactly what's going on. We assume based on ourselves:
>Every member of a group which is held together by
some common occupation or interest sees every other member not
just empirically, but on the basis of an aprioric principle which the
group imposes on everyone of its participants. Among officers,
church members, employees, scholars, or members of a family,
every member regards the other with the unquestioned assumption
that he is a member of "my group." p. 11

In other words, when we see an individual we impute group level characteristics. But this is essentially a distortion of that other individual. So,

>The distortions derive from all these a
priori, operative categories: from the individual's type as man,
from the idea of his perfection, and from the general society to
which he belongs. p.12

We use social categories but also some category of individual when understanding each other. That is, the individual is imputed based on social categories, but we also assume each person is unique in some way.

>the way in which he is sociated is determined
or codetermined by the way in which he is not...This extrasocial nature-a man's temperament,
fate, interests, worth as a personality-gives a certain
nuance to the picture formed by all who meet him. It intermixes
his social picture with non-social imponderables-however little
they may change his dominant activities as a bureaucrat or businessman
or officer. p.13

Different people move between the poles of totally social (a priest operating as a priest is not thought of by his individual personality) and the individual (a person at a market is expressing their will without any concern for the social)

</def>What is a society for Simmel?: A society is a structure which consists of beings who stand inside and outside of it at the same time</def>

>The question has
even been raised as to whether the individual is anything more
than a vessel in which elements existing before him are mixed in
varying measures. For even if these elements ultimately are produced
by the individual himself, his contribution is only minimal;
only as individuals converge in species and society do the
factors arise whose synthesis results in any discernible degree of
individuality. On the other hand, we see ourselves as members of
society. In this capacity we depend on it. By our life and its meaning
and purpose, we are as inextricably woven into society, as a
synchronic, coexisting phenomenon, as we are, as products, into
diachronic, successive society. p.16


We can try and separate society from the individual but the individual makes up all of the idiosyncratic data that constitutes society.

Individuals are directed by society to certain destinies.
>In the same way, the apriority of causality as a determining
precondition of cognition depends neither on its conscious
formulation in specific concepts nor on the behavior of reality,
as we grasp it psychologically, in accord or discord with it. For our
cognition is based on the premise of a pre-established harmony
that exists between our psychological energies, however individualized
they may be, and external, objective existence. This
existence always remains immediate, no matter how many attempts
there have been to show, metaphysically or psychologically,
that it is the intellect's own product. In a similar fashion, social life
presupposes an unquestionable harmony between the individual
and society as a whole. p.20

<def>How does the concept of a vocation fit into Simmel's understanding of the relationship between the individual and society?: The more highly developed concept of vocation refers to a particular phenomenon; On the one hand, society within itself produces and offers to the individual a place which-however different in content and delimitation it may be from other places-can be filled by many individuals, and which is, for this reason, something anonymous, as it were. On the other hand, this place, in spite of its general character, is nevertheless taken by the individual on the basis of an inner calling, a qualification felt to be intimately personal. For such a thing as vocation to be possible, there must exist that harmony, whatever its origin, between the structure and development of society, and individual qualities and impulses. p.21</def>

# The Problem of Sociology

People act in society because of certain drives or purposes. In those interactions individuals influence and are influenced by others.

<def>What is a social form? What is social content?: The ways in which individuals interact with one another, form bonds and have types of influence. Social content is the stuff that individuals interact about, for example sex, money, religion. We cannot have one without the other.</def>

>Any social phenomenon or process is composed
of two elements which in reality are inseparable: on the one
hand, an interest, a purpose, or a motive; on the other, a form or
mode of interaction among individuals through which, or in the
shape of which, that content attains social reality. p.24

So how do we get to a scientific study of society when we have these two separate parts?
>To separate, by scientific abstraction, these two
factors of form and content which are in reality inseparably united;
to detach by analysis the forms of interaction or sociation from
their contents (through which alone these forms become social
forms); and to bring them together systematically under a consistent
scientific viewpoint-this seems to me the basis for the
only, as well as the entire, possibility of a special science of society
as such. p.25

This requires two things:
1. The same form of sociation can be observed iwth different contents.
2. The same content is realized using different forms of sociation.

Also, groups of individuals can become more or less "society" depending on their level of sociation.  We need to study the specific forms of society where individuals act in certain ways.

For instance, what competition is as a form of relation among groups in different societies.

>What we are suggesting, in brief, is that similar elements be singled out
of the complex phenomena so as to secure a cross-section, whereby
dissimilar elements-in our case the contents-reciprocally paralyze
each other, as it were. p. 29

# Part III, Ch. 10: The Stranger (143-149)

Who is the wanderer who shows up and may or may not stick around? He is fixed in a social circle, but is also separate from it fundamentally. In network type terms, Simmel defines this as:

<def>How does simmel define the stranger?:In the case of the stranger, the union of closeness and remoteness involved in every human relationship is patterned in a way that may be succinctly formulated as follows - the distance within this relation indicates that one who is close by is remote, but his strangeness indicates that one who is remote is near p.143</def>

Whatever that means! Then Simmel makes a case for what is essentially structural holes, arguing that strangers in new groups bring their strangeness along with them and it makes them better. The Jew is the perennial/classic example of the stranger.

But the stranger is also objective because they are not attached. For instance, sometimes judges are chosen particularly for their strageness (in italy at some time).

These strangers are freer in their judgement abstractly in a way that others who are technically ree are not.
<def>Why is the stranger the freer man for Simmel?: he is the freer man, practically and theoretically; he examines conditions with less prejudice; he assesses them against standards that are more general and more objective; and his actions are not confined by custom, piety, or precedent p.146</def>

>The stranger
is close to us insofar as we feel between him and ourselves similarities
of nationality or social position, of occupation or of general
human nature. He is far from us insofar as these similarities extend
beyond him and us, and connect us only because they connect a
great many people. p.147

This is meant to explain why we see strangers from other countries as a "type" rather than individuals.

# Part III, Ch. 11: The Poor (150-178)

We all exist in a network of rights and obligations. When we think speicifically about rights, we think about the moral relations between individuals. We are responsible to other people, but we really only (perhaps) are concerned wtih our inner selves here. This is a dualism between sentiments here, whether they are inward or outward facing. This is the difference between "rights" and "duties" or obligations. What are the rights of the poor and what is our duty to the poor?

We realize there are some rights to the poor, but where does our duty to charity, or to which poor, come in?
>Where assistance to the poor has its raison d' etre
in an organic link between elements, the rights of the poor are more
highly emphasized, whether their religious premise derives from a
metaphysical unity or their kinship or tribal basis from a biological
unity. We will see, in contrast, that when assistance to the
poor derives teleologically from a goal one hopes to pursue in this
way, rather than from the causal basis of a real and effective unity
among all the members of the group, the rights of the poor dwindle
to nothingness p.153

But at the same time, when helping the poor is inward facing (as part of doing good works) then things change. Maybe these good works are fungible or not totally thought through.

Helping the poor is strange because it is absolutely personal, it's supposed to help out certain individuals. BUt really:
>The goal of
assistance is precisely to mitigate certain extreme manifestations
of social differentiation, so that the social structure may continue
to be based on this differentiation...When this purely social and centralist teleology prevails, assistance to the poor offers perhaps the greatest sociological tension
between the direct and the indirect goals of an action. The alleviation
of personal need is emotionally so categorical an end-in-itself,
that to deprive it of this ultimate purpose and to convert it into a
mere technique for the transsubjective ends of a social unit constitutes
a significant triumph for the latter. This distantiation between
the individual and the social unit-despite its lack of visibilityis
more fundamental and radical in its abstractness and coldness
than sacrifices of the individual for the collectivity in which the
means and the ends tend to be bound together by a chain of
sentiments. p.155-6

In other words, it is something like an individual right (not to be so destitute) carried out by a sociological function (to maintain the fundamental structure of relations)

And once individuals experience a relation (even if it is individual and idiosyncratic) it starts to be conceived as a regularity, and even a right, something that is due to the individual.

>We have seen so far two forms of the relation between right
and obligation: the poor have a right to assistance; and there exists
an obligation to assist them, an obligation which is not oriented
toward the poor as having a right, but toward society to whose
preservation this obligation contributes and which the society demands
from its organs or from certain groups. But along with
these two forms there exists a third, which probably dominates the
moral consciousness: the collectivity and well-to-do persons have
the obligation to assist the poor, and this obligation has its sufficient
goal in the alleviation of the situation of the poor; p.164

A good summary of some of the point below:
>This distinction may be elaborated further. It is necessary to
start from poverty as an objectively determined phenomenon and
to attempt to eliminate it as such. Whoever the poor may be and
whatever the individual causes that produce it and the individual
consequences it produces, poverty requires assistance, compensation
for this social deficiency. But, on the other hand, interest may
be directed to the poor person, who is assisted unquestionably because
he is poor, not for the purpose of eliminating poverty in
general pro rata, but rather to help this particular poor person. His
poverty operates here as an individal and specific characteristic; it
serves as the immediate occasion for being concerned wit4 .\lim;
but the individual as a whole should be put into such a situation
that poverty would disappear by itself. For this reason assistance
derived from the first attitude is directed more to the fact of poverty;
and assistance derived from the second attitude, on the other
hand, to its cause. Incidentally, it is of sociological importance to
observe that the natural distribution of the two types of assistance
between the State and private individuals is modified as soon as
one follows up the causal chain one step further. p.169

Three motivations for individuals - altruism, egoism, and objective norms.

The point is that the poor person occupies a strange place in the relationship between the group and the individual, and the obligations and rights of the poor person are effected by how the social group views the situation.

# Part IV, Ch. 16: Subjective Culture (227-234)

History is simply the course of events that are the result of natural interrelationships.   
Really nature and culture are two ways of seeing the same phenomenon.
But people are also cultivated through culture.
Just as trees can be cultivated to grow the best wood for a ship, individuals can be cultivated to reach their "potentialities"

>Only the human soul contains the developmental potentialities
whose goals are determined purely in the teleology of
its own nature. It does not attain these goals by mere inherent
growth processes, which we call natural, but through the application,
at a certain point of a technique, of a deliberate intervention. p.229

That intervention is the cultivation of culture.

>Therefore we are not yet cultivated
just because we possess certain facts or skills; specialization
is not equivalent to culture, no matter how excellent the objective
contents it produces. Culture is created only when these one-sided
perfections are ordered within the total structure of the soul, when
the disharmonies of the soul's elements are resolved by elevation
to a higher plane; in short, when each contributes to the perfection
of the whole p.232

Really this is a very specific version of culture that we don't see very much, that is, the production of cultural works that are revered by a whole.

>The more separated
a product is from the subjective spirituality of its creator, the more
it is integrated into an objective order-the more distinct is its
cultural significance and the more suited it is to become a general
means for the cultivation of many individual souls. p.233

BUt there is some difference between subjective and objective culture.  And man is cultivated (subjectively) by his relationship to the objective (cultivated) objects.

# Part V, Ch. 18: Group Expansion and the Development of Individuality (251-293)

<def>How do individuals develop some type of individuality in their personality?: Individuation of personality, on the one hand, and the influences, interests, and relationships that attach the personality to its social circle, on the other hand, show a pattern of interdependent development that appears in the most diverse historical and institutional setting as a typical form. Individuality in being and action generally increases to the degree that the social circle encompassing the individual expands. p.252 </def>

This is because people who are close to each other become alike in certain ways. People will become friends with each other merely by relations as opposed to any true interests. In a group, individuals do certain things like compete fo rhigh or low status, and bonds are born by people who share the same type of status, and these bonds have strane hold over individuals. Here an example of a group is a certain guild in a certain area.

>An Englishman who had lived for many years in India once
told me that it was impossible for a European to get at all close to
the natives where castes existed; but that where caste divisions did
not prevail this was very easy. The insularity of the caste-maintained
by an internal uniformity no less strict than its exclusion of
outsiders-seems to inhibit the development of what one has to call
a more universal humanity, which is what makes relationships between
racial aliens possible. p.256

>Expressed in a very terse schema, the elements of a distinctive
social circle are undifferentiated, and the elements of a circle that
is not distinctive are differentiated. Of course this is not a sociological
"natural law," but rather what might be called a phenomenological
formula that seeks to conceptualize the regular outcome
of regularly coexisting sequences of events. It designates no cause
of phenomena; instead, it designates a single phenomenon whose
underlying, general structure is represented in each individual case
as the effect of very diverse causes, but causes whose combined effect
is always to release identical formative energies p.257

This is, as far as I can tell, the main takeaway of this part. Individuals differentiate themselves in all sorts of ways, and then in the end group that they become a part of, they become quite similar.

## The Basic Relation as a Dualistic Drive
We live in two ways, as an individual of a social circle with tangible distance between each other member, but also as a member of the circle separate from individuals not in the circle.

Simmel argues that people have a dualistic drive to see ourselves as part of a whole but also to distinguish ourselves from others within that whole.

>For example,
in certain circles, and perhaps even in certain peoples,
where extravagance, nervous enthusiasm, and moody impulsiveness
predominate, we notice nonetheless a decidedly slavish preoccupation
with fashion. One person perpetrates some madness, and
it is aped by all the others as though they were automatons. In contrast,
there are other circles whose life style is of a more sober and
soldierly cut, hardly as colorful as the former, but whose members
have a far stronger individuality drive, and distinguish themselves
much more sharply and concisely within their uniform and simple
life style than do those others in their bright and transitory way.
So in one case, the totality has a very individual character, but its
parts are very much alike; in the other, the totality is less colorful
and less modeled on an extreme, but its parts are strikingly differentiated
from one another. p.260

## Stages of Social Commitment

People have some connection to realtively small and relatively large social circles.

>The lone individual cannot
save himself from the totality: only by surrendering a part of his
absolute ego to a few others, joining himself in with them, can he
preserve his sense of individuality and still avoid excessive isolation,
bitterness, and idiosyncrasy p.262

The family is a good example because you feel linked to your family but you also distinguish yourself from others in your family. So sometimes it is a unitary structure in relation to toher groups, and sometimes is an intermediate between the family and the individual.

Basically what we have are superimposed circles affecting one another. Each circle can have agency on its own, be affected and reacting to a larger circle its a part of, or be the intermediate between larger circles and smaller circle/entities.

Some groups work on their own logics in individual ways motivated by some drive. Some groups work as the intermediate of many drives. And sometimes those intermediate circles (the family between the individual and the state for instance) are activated, and sometimes they aren't. And sometimes people get attached between the first and third levels. That is, patriotism.

## Freedom and Individuality

Some concept of individual freedom is held up at group and individual levels, but the level of freedom is related to the size of the group and how the group shapes sociation. Individuality means freedom and responsibiility for oneself. But also the individual distinguishes himself from others and acts in ways that suits only him.

>It is the essence of
"being cultured" that our purely personal dispositions are sometimes
realized as the form of what is given as a content of objective
culture [Geist], sometimes as the content of what is given as a
form in objective culture. Only in this synthesis does our mental
life attain its full idiom and personality; only thereby do its unique
and wholly individual attributes become tangibly incarnated. p.273

I'm not sure if I'm really getting the point here totally.

## General Modes of Actualization of the Correlation

>Perhaps one could symbolically express this complex
of relations by saying that the narrower circle constitutes in some
measure an intermediate proportionality between individuality and
the expanded group. Thus the narrower circle, closed upon itself
and requiring no other factor, can be seen to result in the same
outcome of life chances as results from the conjunction of individuality
and the large circle. p.282

>It is no more than a corollary of the idea of such a relation
between individuality and sociality if we state the following: as
man as individual, and so his attributes as man qua man, come to
replace man as social element in the foreground of interest, the
bond must tighten that pulls him-over the head of his social
group, as it were--toward all that is human, suggesting to him the
notion of an ideal unity of mankind. There need he no mistake
about this developmental tendency, even though in generating this
notion of ideal unity-which is really logically required-it has
been restricted by all manner of historical limitations.

The end of this got a little confusing, but it essentially was arguing that the three layers of social fabric, individual, intermediary groups, and large groups (nation/humanity) interact with each other in ways that effect an individual's culture and will. The structure and relation of large groups to intermediary groups, and the things these groups stand for is a result of how other larger aspects are structured (i think).


# Part V, Ch. 19: Fashion (294-323)
There is always some duality between what were born into and how we want to individualize ourselves.
What we are born into is developed partially by our drive to imitate. To an extent, we content ourselves with similarity. But sometimes imitation is seen as negative.

>If we should study the history of fashions (which hitherto
have been examined only from the view-point of the development
of their contents) in connection with their importance for the form
of the social process, we should find that it reflects the history of
the attempts to adjust the satisfaction of the two counter-tendencies
more and more perfectly to the condition of the existing individual
and social culture p.297

And this union and exclusion often takes place more or less on the group level.
But the idea is that something becomes "fashion" only when it is separated from some deeper motive and moves on a trajectory of it own. Simmel argues that the upper class will move away from a certain fashion as soon as a lower class copies it (but it seems like we actually have the opposite.)
To search for new things we look outside of our social circle to bring back novelty.

So we essentially use fashion as a way to group yourselves together, but again to exclude yourself from others.  For instance, when a "primitive people" has a dance, they all act in a somewhat similar way (as themselves) but different from the outside world. And they have less need to differentiate themselves from others within their group, so their fashion stays relatively stable.

In other groups there is a curve for the fashions popularity in terms of how "fashionable" it is, how it is adopted. But I'm jut not at all convinced by this.

<def>What is the relationship between norms and notoriety, and how does fashion have a peculiar role in this definiton: Speaking broadly, it is characteristic of a standard set by a general body, that its acceptance by anyone individual does not call attention to him; in other words, a positive adoption of a given norm signifies nothing. Whoever keeps the laws the breaking of which is punished by the penal code, whoever lives up to the social forms prescribed by his class, gains no conspicuousness or notoriety. The slightest infraction or opposition, however, is immediately noticed and places the individual in an exceptional position by calling the attention of the public to his action. All such norms do not assume positive importance for the individual until he begins to depart from them. It is peculiarly characteristic of fashion that it renders possible a social obedience, which at the same time is a form of individual differentiation. p.305 </def>

But fashion is a socially acceptable and non-intense way to distinguish yourself from the group that does not lead to social upheaval or anything.

A summary from Simmel:
>To sum up, the peculiarly piquant and suggestive attraction of
fashion lies in the contrast between its extensive, all-embracing
distribution and its rapid and complete disintegration; and with
the latter of these characteristics the apparent claim to permanent
acceptance again stands in contrast. Furthermore, fashion depends
no less upon the narrow distinctions it draws for a given circle,
the intimate connection of which it expresses in the terms of both
cause and effect, than it does upon the decisiveness with which it
separates the given circle from others. And, finally, fashion is
based on adoption by a social set, which demands mutual imitation
from its members and thereby releases the individual of all responsibility-
ethical and aesthetic-as well as of the possibility of
producing within these limits individual accentuation and original
shading of the elements of fashion. Thus fashion is shown to be an
objective characteristic grouping upon equal terms by social expediency
of the antagonistic tendencies of life. p.322-323


# Part V, Ch. 20: The Metropolis and Mental Life (324-340)

Everything that Simmel cares about (at least in this book as far as I can tell) is how the individual relates to its various social groups. The individual wants to maintain independence while also being part of the whole.

The more calculating/intellectual you see something, the less it becomes a personal relationship? And the money economy makes us think like this because of its quantitative and impersonal tendencies.

As a result we tend to become indifferent to many others in metropolitan life.

>From this stage social
evolution proceeds simultaneously in two divergent but none the
less corresponding directions. In the measure that the group grows
numerically, spatially, and in the meaningful content of life, its
immediate inner unity and the definiteness of its original demarcation
against others are weakened and rendered mild by reciprocal
interactions and interconnections. And at the same time the individual
gains a freedom of movement far beyond the first jealous
delimitation, and gains also a peculiarity and individuality to
which the division of labor in groups, which have become larger,
gives both occasion and necessity p. 332

When a city person moves to the town they feel constricted by the small circles and the limited relationships. Cities are divided up in a lot more ways which makes the individual quite individual and the relationships between individuals more impersonal. It allows individuals to strive for a truly individual existence, producing individual culture.

>From one angle life is made infinitely more easy in the sense that stimulations, interests,
and the taking up of time and attention, present themselves from
all sides and carry it in a stream which scarcely requires any individual
efforts for its ongoing. But from another angle, life is composed
more and more of these impersonal cultural elements and
existing goods and values which seek to suppress peculiar personal
interests and incomparabilities. As a result, in order that this most
personal element be saved, extremities and peculiarities and individualizations
must be produced and they must be over-exaggerated
merely to be brought into the awareness even of the individual
himself p.338
