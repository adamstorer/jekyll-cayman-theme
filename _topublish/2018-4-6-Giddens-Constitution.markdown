# introduction

There was, for some time, agreement about what sociology was. But now it is a bit more confusing post parsons.
>Notwithstanding the babble
of rival theoretical voices, it is possible to discern certain common
themes in this apparent confusion. One is that most of the schools
of thought in question - with notable exceptions, such as
structuralism and 'post-structuralism' - emphasize the active,
reflexive character of human conduct. That is to say, they are
unified in their rejection of the tendency of the orthodox
consensus to see human behaviour as the resuitof force~ -that
actors neither cont rol nor comprehend. p.xvi

For Giddens, producing social theory is mvoing beyond sociology to thinking about human action. It is also more about explanatory propositions than of tight conceptual schemes, which some versions of "theory" call for.

Some theoretical generalizations are "folk theory," and here there is no discovery, they hold because actors believe them. The other comes from circumstances, of which agents are ignorant of and act upon without knowing.
Structural socialosists are interested in the second part.

>Rather than becoming
preoccupied with epistemological disputes and with the
question of whether or not anything like 'epistemology' in its
time-honoured sense can be formulated at all, those working in
social theory, I suggest, should be concern ed first and foremost
with reworking conceptions of human being and human doing,
social reproduction and social transformation. Of prime importance
in this respect is a du alism that is deeply entrenched in
social theory, a division between objectivism and subjectivism.
Objectivism was a third -ism characterizing the orthodox
consensus, together with n <!~ural ism apd functionalism. In spite
of Parsons's terminology of 'the action frame of reference', there
is no doubt that in his theoretical scheme the object (society)
predominates over lhe subject (the knowledgeable human agent).
Others whose views could be associated with that consensus were
very much less sophisticated in this respect than was Parsons. By
attack ing objectivism - and structural sociology - those
influenced by h ~.rmen e uli cs or by phenomenology were able to
lay bare major shortcomings of those views. But they in turn
veered sharply towards subjectivism.p. xx

Structuration theory is focused on teh duality.A further elabortion of what structure does here:
>'Structure' can be conceptualized abstractly as two aspects of
rules - normative elements and codes of signification. Resources
are also of two kinds: authoritative reso urces, which derive from
the co-ordination of the activity of human agents, and allocative
resources, which stem from control of material products or of
aspects of the material world. What is especially useful for the
guidance of research is the study of, first. the routinized
intersections of practices which are the 'transformation points' in
structural relations and. second, the modes in which institutionalized
practices connect social with system integration. p.xxxi

# Elements of the Theory of Structuration
What separates functionalism and structrualism from hermeneutics and interpretive sociology?

Functionalism and Structuralism - have a naturalistic standpoint, and are inclined towards objectivism. Comte's functionalism looks towards Biology to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the functioning of social system, and to looking at processes of adaptation. Scturcturalism from Levi-Strauss, does not like biologicla analogies - but emphasizes the pre-emininece of the social whole over its individual parts.

Hermeneutics - social and antural sciences are discrepant. The gulf between subject and social object is wide. Here subjectivity is the center of social science, and the material worldis outside of subjective experience.

>Whereas for those schools of thought whi ch tend
towards naturalism subjectivity has been regarded as something
of a mystery, or almost a residual phenomenon , for hermeneutics
it is the world of nature whi ch is opaque - which , unlike human
activity, can be grasped only from the outside. In in terpre tative
SOCiologies, action and meaning are accorded primacy in the
explication of human conduct ; structural concepts are not notably
prominent , and there is not much talk of constra int. For
func tionalism and struc tura lism, however, struc ture (in the
di vergent senses attributed to th at concept) has primacy over
action , and the constraining quali ties of structure are strongly
accentuated


But is the difference purely epistemological? No, Giddens claims they are ontological. How do they relate to structure and constraint?

>The basic
domain of study of the social sciences, according to the theory of
struc turation, is neither the experie nce of the ind ividual ac tor,
nor the existence of any form of societal totality , but social
prac tices ordered across space and time. Human social ac ti vi ties,
like some self-re producing items in nature, are recursive. That is
to say, they are not brought into being by social actors but
continually recreated by them via the very means where by they
express themselves as actors. p.2

We are trying to understand the CONTINUITY of action. THis presumes reflexivity. But this is only possible because of continuity.
<def>Giddens Reflexivity: Not merely self consciousness, but the monitored character of the ongoing flow of soical life. IF a person is acting with purpose, who has reasons for their activities. That is, reflexivity is the continous monitoring of action action, a process</def>

When we're thinking about action, we think of it is as a single instance but giddens wants a flow. For Giddens, a stratified model has different levels of monitoring, rationalization and motivation of action.

We also realize that there aresome uncosncious motivations.

## The Agent, Agency

Agents monitor things all the time, this is the reflexive aspect. We start with some unackwnoledged conditions of action, which lead into monitoring, ratioanlization, and motivation, which have uninteded consequences which become the new uanckwnoledged conditions.

For Giddens we can separate reflection, rationalization and monitoring.
Motives are the wants which prompt action. It deals with potentials for action, with direct purchase to an outcome. This is separate from Reflection, which is how all human action takes place. Tjese motivations can be unconscious.So really we have three levels of consciousness:
<def>Giddens three levels of consciousness: Discursive consciousness, pratical consciousness, unconscious motives</def>

But our acts continue to have an unitended consequence in the flow of action.
>Thus one of the
reg ular consequences of my speaking or writing English in a
correct way is to contribute to the reproduction of the English
language as a whole. My speaking English correctly is intentional ;
the contribution I make to the reproduction of the la nguage is
not. But how should we fonnulate what unintended consequences
are? p.8

BUtwhat level of intention in the consequence is necessary for agency?

For Giddens, agency is about the ability to do things, not the intentions.
>Agency
conce rns events of which an individual is the perpe trator, in the
sense that the individual could , at any phase in a given seque nce
of conduc t, have acted differe ntly. p9

What is the divide between intentional and unintentional
<def>Unintended Action: An act which its perpetrator knows, or believes, will have a particular quality or outcome and where such knwoledge is utilized by the author of the act to achieve this quality or outcome. The agent can set off a chain of events</def>

>A
given item of acti vity may have either (a) non-significant or (b)
significant conseque nces; and e ither (c) singly signiricant
consequences or (d) multiply significant consequences. What is
judged 'significant ' will depend upon the nature of the study
being undertak en or the theory being developed p.12

Latent functions are, in a way, unintended consequences of activity.  

WE hae three types of unintended consequences to make sense of -
1. When someone turns on the light and scares away a prowler, we are interested in the "cumulation of events deriving from an initiating circumstance without which that cumulation would not have been found." Understanding the initiation event in a pattern of events
2. Understanding how a mass of individual activities leads to an unintended result. The outcome of a series of rational acts produced together create an irrational act. Think ethnic segregation.
3. Where the interest of the anlayst is in the mechanisms of reproduction of the instiuttionalized practices. Uninteded consequences form the conditions of further action.

## Agency and Power

Action allows someoene to intervene in the world, with the effect of influencing a specific process or state of affairs. Or to refrain from action with the same effect. If the (in)action does not influence a process or state of affairs,

>Expressing these observations in another way, we can say that
action logically involves power in the sense of transfoqnative
capacity, In t~is sense, the most all-embracing meaning of 'power',
power is logically prior to subjectivity, to the constitution of the
reflexive monitoring of conduct. p. 15

That is, intent or will, or as a property. These are really the two faces of power:
Resources are structured propoerties of social systems, drawn upon and reproduced by knowledgeable agents in teh course of interaction. Power is  exercised through resources.
>But all forms of dependence offer some resources whe reby those
who are subordinat e can influ ence the acti vities of their superiors,
This is what I call the dialectic of control in socia l systems. p.16

## Structure, Structuration
<def>Rules: Techniques of generalizable procedures applied in the enactment/reproduction of social practices</def>

We have different formulations of rules, such as tacit or discursive, informal or formal, weakly or strongly sanctioned.

<def>Structure for Giddens: Isolatable sets of rules and resources organized as properties of social system. Rules constitute meaning and speak to sanctioning. Part of the enduring parts of social systems. Particularly rules and resources recusively involved in institutions. These give solidity across space and time.  </def>

<def>System: Reproduced relations between actors or collectivities. Organized as regular social practices.</def>

<def>Structurat: COnditions governing the continuity or transmutation of structures, and therefore the reproduction of social systems</def>

>Structure, as recursively
organized sets of rules and resources, is out of time and space,
save in its instantiations and co-o rdination as memory traces, and
is marked by an 'absence of the subj ect'. The social systems in
which structure is recursively implicated, on the contrary,
comprise the situated activities of human agents, reproduced
across time and space. Analysing th e struc turation of social (
systems means studying the modes in which such systems, i
grounded in the knowledgeable acti vities of situated actors who \
draw upon rules and resources in the diversity of action contexts, )
are produced and reproduced in interact io n. Crucial to the idea
o f structuration is the theorem of the duality of structure, which
is logically implied in the arguments portrayed above. The
{o nslitution of agents and S!!uctures are not two i"-~ependently
given sets of phenomenenonm ,15~ re present a duali.!}'.p.25

<def>Duality of structure: The structural properties of social systems are both medium and outcomes of the practices they recursively organized. </def>

>Accordign to structuration theory, the moment of the production of action is also one of reproduction in the contexts of the day to day enactment of social life. p.26

WE have to think about social and system integration. Socila integration is reciprocity between actors in the context of copresence. System integration is the reciprocity between actors or collectives across extended tiem space.

## Forms of Institution
>'Interpre tative schemes' are the modes
o f typifica tion incorporated within actors' slocks of knowledge,
applied reflexively in the sustaini ng of communica tion. T he stocks
o f knowledge which ac tors draw upon in the produc tion and
r..:production of in terac tion are the same as those where by they
afe ~I b l e to make acco unts, offer reasons, etc p.29

We must realize that the structural aspect of social systems must take into account in some way reflexively monitored social conduct. That is, domination, signification and legitimation. Signfication is always in the middle of domination and legitimation.

Domination depends on allocative and authoritative resources.


# Consciousness, Self and Social Encounters

## Reflexivity, Discursive and Practical Consciousness

WE have our three levels of consciousness which are somewhat related to Freud, but Freud is a little wonky in some parts. We are really thinking about how the unconscious operates.

But again, really we are always thinking about and monitoring our condunt in day-to-day social life.

## Unconscious, Time, Memory

WE have a few levels of consciousness, right? We have discursive consciousness, which means putting things into words. Unconsciousness is  the opposite, not being able to give verbal expression to the promptings of action. It is related to memory, and language. Memory kind of shapes perception, right? This is kind of a long argument that I don't think we need to dive too deeply into.

If we are asked to remember certain things, we only really notice those things.

>later. The main theorems I wish [0 propose run as
follows. Ordinary day-to-day life - in greater or less degree
according to context and the vagaries of individual personality _
involves an ontological security expressing an autonomy of bodily
control within predictable routines. The psychological origins of
ontological sec urity are to be found in basic anxiety-controlling
mechanisms (as indicated by Erikson, whose ideas r discuss in
w~at (ollows), hierarchically ordered as compone nts of personallty.
The generation of feelings of trUSt in others, as the deepestlying
element of the basic security system, depends substantially
upon predictable and caring routines established by parental
figures. The infant is very early on both a giver as well as a
receiver o f trust. As he or she becomes mo re auto nomous
however, the child learns the importance of what a re in Goffman '~
term 'protective devi ces', which susta in the mutuality implied in
tru st via tact and oth er formulae that preserve the face of others.
Ontological security is protected by such devices but maintained
in a more fundam ent al way by the ve ry predictability of ro utine,
something whic h is ntdically disrupted in critical situ<t tions. p50

## Anxiety and Trust

Basically the thesis here is that we have a constant anxiety, and our parents shield us from it. Certain social interactions create that same kind of trust.

We are searching for a kind of ontological security based on predictable encounters and routines.

## Routinization and Motivation

Routine is integral to the conintuity of the agent - and to the instutitions of society.
>An examination of routinization, I shall
claim , provides us with a master key to explicating the
characteristic forms of relation between the basic security system
on the one hand and the reflexively constituted processes inherent
in the episodic character of encounters on the other. p.60

We think of regular routines which have continuity, and then critical situations where we have a radical disjuncture.

##  Presence, Co-Presence and Social Integration

>In the course of their
daily ac ti vities individuals e nCOunter each other in si tua ted
contexts of interaction - inte raction with others who are '
physically co-present p.64

When people are together and acting in ways which fit our expectations, we can have social integration due to the ontological security it provides.

Goffman provides a typology of interactions, and accounts for their seriality, or how often they occur.



# Structure, System, Social Reproduction

Basically we want to take opposing things and think of them as working together.

The idea is again that society is not constraining. They are enabling as well as constraining.

Society both creates social interaction/association, and is also a bounded unity. They are a cluster of insitutions such as a specific territory, a specific time, some set of normative elements. Some common identifying feeling.

This is a bit much. It is a much more quasi-rational legal system.


## Structure and Constraint

Structuration is all about enabling and constraining. If structure is rules and resources, maybe it is not clear where

>The point here is that 'social facts' have properties that confro nt
each single indi vidual as 'objective' features which limit that
individual's scope of action. T hey are not just external but also
externally defin ed, incorporated in what others do or in what
they consider right and pro per to do.

So waht is constraint? There are limits upon the physicial capacities of the human body. There is a time-geographic sense in which people are constrained by space and time.

Think about power as a source of constraint. One uses their power to enable themselves to act, which is a source of enabling, also as a way to stop action, which is constraint. This is kind of a dialectic of control.

SO WE HAVE MATERIAL CONSTRAINT - DERIVING FROM THE CHARACTER OF THE MATERIAL WORLD. Negative Sanction - constraint due to punative actions. And Structural Constraint - The context of action.

>All stru ctural propert ies of social systems have a similar
·ohjectivity' vis-d-vis the individual agent. How far th ese are
constraining qualities varies according to the conlext and nature
Ilf any given sequence of action or strip of interaction. ln other
words. the feasible options open to agents may be greater than in
Ihe case of the labour contract example p. 178

There can be depersonalized social forces and causal generalizations. Sometimes forces can appear inevitable because the perceived choices are so small. But we really do have to take into account the reasoning behavior of the agent.
>take it as one of the main implicat io ns of the foregoing points
that there is no such entity as a distin ctive type of 'structural
explanation' in the social sciences; all explanations will involve at
least implicit reference both to the purposive, reasoning behaviour
o f agents and to its intersection with constraining and enabling
features o f the social and material contexts of that behaviour. p. 179

In part, constraint is due to reification - in that some "choices" seem like "non choices" and some possibilities seems like facts, and in that way individuals ignore other potential ways of acting and see their agency as driven by something else.

We can still in some ways look at the structural principles of society and divide them into types, and look at the way different societies interact and diide them into type.

Really we have three things:
Structural Principles - Principles of Organization of Societal Totalities - (like Capitalism)
Structures - Rule-resource sets, involved int he institutional articulation of social systems
Structural properties - Institutionalized features of social systems, stretching across time and space

Think of private property for Marx - it reolves around money capital labour contract and profit.

SO we have - relexive monitoring of action and some set of structural properties. Due to the duality of structure these have an influence on each other over time. And we also have structural principles.

>All structural properties of social systems, to repeat a
Icading theme of strucLUration theory, are the medium and
outcome of the contingently accomplished activities of situated
a<.:tors. The reflexive monitoring of action in situations of co·
presence is the main anchoring feature of social integration , but
hoth the conditions and the outcomes of situated interaction
stretch far beyond those situations as such. The mechanisms of
'stre tching' are variable but in modern societ ies tend to involve
reflexive monitoring itself. That is to say, understanding the
cunditions of system reproduc tion becomes part of those
conditions of system reproduction as such. p. 191

There are sometimes circuits of reproduction where we see tracks (like M-C-M) that lead us to where we started.

Sometimes we find some notion of contradiction in action.

>Structural contradiction refers to the constitutive features of
human socreties .. T suggest that structural principles operate in
contradiction. What I mean by this is that structural principles
o perate in terms of one another but yet also contravene each
ol heLJ! 'Contradiction' in this sense can be further divided into
I woo By primary contradictions I refer to those which enter into
I he constitution of societal totalities; by secondary contradictions
I mean those which are dependent upon, or are brought into
heing by, primary contradictions. p. 193

# Structuration Theory, Empirical Reserch, and Social Critique

A reiteration of conceptions

1. Humans are knowledgeable agents they know about their conditions and ay to day lives. There is a complexity to this knowledge. Actors can also describe why they do what they do, but they also make decisions without thinking about it.
2. Knowledge is bounded by the unconsicous, and by the unacknowledged unintended consequences and conditions ofaction.
3. Day to day life is important in understanding reproduction of institutionalized practices. The connection to institutions is there but is far-flung.
4. Routine is the predominant form of day-to-day social activity. They are the prime expression of the duality of structure. People need routines to sustain "ontological security".
5. Context for action is based on time-space boundaries, other actors, and awareness and use of these phenomenon to influence or control interactions.
6. Social identites are markers associated with rights obligationa nd sanctions.
7. Constraints to action are associated with structural properties of social systems.
8. Structural principles specify overall types of society. Closure of societal totalities and social systems is variable. Socieities may  not be easily defined.
9. Power is important. It is one of several concepts of social science all clustered around the relations of action and strucutre.
10. There is no aspect of social organization and reproduction which lay actors cannot comprehend and actively incorporate what they do.
