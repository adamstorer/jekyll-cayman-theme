In part, I see this article as good documentation for a few things. First, it seems like it takes us to about the historical end of a parsonian style attempt to turn a bunch of theoretical ideas into measurable questions in order to get a sense of how these raw values or states contribute to social action. I really like it for this reason, and think a renaissance of this type would be really interesting. The second is that, often times with theory it is really hard to pin down ideas into testable concepts - but this "grounding for measurement" is so important to sharpening ideas and to building empirical claims, but is so often forgotten. It makes me want to track the scales we've made in sociology over some time.


Many people consider the study of alienation to be dead, and Lee 1972 wrote an obituary for it.
However there is:
1. Empirical Interest in Alienation
2. Theory which makes use of alienation without using the term itself.

But what is alienation? It's hard to pin down.

Schacht (1970) draws from Hegel, Marx, and Fromm, as well as others to say:
<def>Schacht (1970) view on alienation Part A: There has always been confusion around the word, for instance thought of both in terms of separation and surrender in Hegel.</def>
<def>Schacht (1970) view on alienation Part B: The definition of the term comes from a mix of prescriptive and descriptive uses.</def>

In more recent studies, we see a lot of uses which focus on the fall from some kind of perfection.


#### Varieties of Alienation
<def>Tourraine on alienation 1: An Integral Aspect of Social Class Relations</def>
<def>Tourraine on alienation 2: Dominated actor adopts orientations and social practices determined by and in the interests of the dominating class</def>
<def>Tourraine on alienation 3: Alienation creates a contradiction between behavior that corresponds to his true situation and behavior imposed by the going institutions in the service of the dominant order.</def>

I am not sure how convinced I am by this concept. There is, however, some notion of "discrepancy" that falls through it all. But, Seeman shows, there can be the discrepancy in all sorts of places, from work, to politics, to the gap between the real and the ideal, or to an actors own sense of loss.

Seeman uses the notion of cultural estrangement.
<def>Seeman Cultural Estrangement: perceived gap between the going values in a society and the individual's own standards</def>

Seeman develops six categories of alienation in the piece:
<def>sSix Varieties of Alienation - powerlessness: sense of low control vs mastery over events </def>
<def>Six Varieties of Alienation - meaninglessness: sense of incomprehensibility vs understanding of personal and social affairs</def>
<def>Six Varieties of Alienation - normlessness: high expectancies for commit to socially unapproved means vs convmentional means for achieving goals </def>
<def>Six Varieties of Alienation - cultural estrangement: individual rejection of commonly held values in the society vs commitment to the society  </def>
<def>Six Varieties of Alienation - self-estrangement: the individual's engagement in activities that are not intrinsically rewarding vs involvement in a task or activity for its own sake </def>
<def>Six Varieties of Alienation - social isolation: sense of exclusion vs social acceptance</def>
<def>Six Varieties of Alienation - cultural estrangement: sense of exclusion vs social acceptance</def>

<def>Seeman's Six Varieties of Alienation: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, cultural estrangement, self-estrangement, social isolation</def>

## powerlessness
There were a lot of ways to try and study how much you've mastered something, and these sometimes correlated with success. Many studies of powelressness have thought of it in the negative, and seen it as one simple thing. However breaking down the questions is of course useful.  Studies in powerlessness often do not go much more deeply then alienation questions separating the individual from society. From ideas like this we get something like, high system powerlessness but low individual powerlessness create alienation. The other question is, is this thing volatile, free floating, or stable. Longitudinal questions give us the idea that ideas of alienation are pretty stable.

We sometimes see mastery show up, but we also people who respond to pleas of political action, or are they less oriented to learning and achievement?

## meaninglessness

The meaninglessness measure seems to overlap with other models. It is strange that our measures of meaninglessnessare so murky because we often think of life as, in part, a search for meaning. We see meaninglessness, for instance, in anomie. Basically, the notion with meaninglessness is that we are not doing enoguh to study it.

## normlessness

Along with meaninglessness we have normlessness under some general notion of anomie.
Norms are conceived of from both the individual and the structural point of view.  Structural anomie, is a widespread disrespect for the norms of a society. The problem is that rates we use to measure anomie are also how we describe them a lot of the time. (There is a question here, I think, in terms of whether there is THOUGHT TO BE disrespect by an indiviudal, or whether there actually is, since these two things are not well known)

A typical normlessness question might be "Everything is relative and there just aren't any definite rules to live by"

But also, is this part of trusting others?


## self-estrangement

In some sense, this is like Marx's master theme. IN some way men adopt inauthentic, self-estranged life. Sometimes it means that you can't fulfill your potential, or sometimes it means low self esteem. People just don't have a good sense of how to quanitfy it. Or, you might see other as instrumental instead of human. OR where you see other objects as mere things and don't take them for what they are. But again, what does tha tmean?

In the workplace, they are often thoguht to be tasks that are self-fulfilling, self-respecting, and allow for a latitutd of personal control.

## social isolation

Maybe there is some broad social loneliness, or some sense of identity within a collectivity.

## cultural estrangement

But how can you tell who are the outsiders? how do you know?
