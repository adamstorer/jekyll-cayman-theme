Abstract: "What culture is and what culture does are the subjects of conceptual confusion throughout social theory. This state of affairs is attributed to a pervasive Myth of Cultural Integration which wrongly conflates Cultural System integration (a logical property characterizing relations between ideas) with Socio-Cultural integration (a causal property pertaining to relations between people). A reconceptualization of culture in terms of analytical dualism is proposed, for it is suggested that an examination of the interplay between Cultural System integration and Socio-Cultural integration will give a better explanatory purchase on cultural dynamics and also allow culture to be examined in the same generic manner as structure."

>What culture is and what culture does are the subjects of conceptual confusion throughout social theory. This state of affairs is attributed to a pervasive Myth of Cultural Integration which wrongly conflates Cultural System integration (a logical property characterizing relations between ideas) with Socio-Cultural integration (a causal property pertaining to relations between people). A reconceptualization of culture in terms of analytical dualism is proposed, for it is suggested that an examination of the interplay between Cultural System integration and Socio-Cultural integration will give a better explanatory purchase on cultural dynamics and also allow culture to be examined in the same generic manner as structure.


Archeer argues culture plays a strange role in sociology. Descriptively it is quite vague and ends up being the poor relation to structure or the supreme independent variable, or dependence on everything else. There is no true meaning to the word here.

Archeer believes these differences come from a myth of cultural unity. This myth often goes unexamined, and people focus too much on how to incorporate it into whatever they are doing.
There is thus some asumption that there is always a coherent cultural system that can be uncovered. Archeer blames this on Parsons but I actually think that this is perhaps unfair. In Marx too we get some notion of "hegemonic culture" that plays along with this idea.

<def>What are the two big problems with cultural uniformity for Archeer?: Archeer argues the two big problems with this are logical coherence and causal consensus. There is not as much internal compatibility between the components of culture, and there is not some imposed uniformity. Moreover, these are often conflated as being one in the same thing. p.336</def>

But if we separate these two things, and understand them as scales, this gives us an analytical grip on cultural analysis.

Archeer calls the sliding scale of logical coherence the "Cultural System of Integration" and causal cohesion as the "Socio-Cultural Integration"

<def>What are the two sliding scales that Archeer proposes for understanding culture?: The Cultural System of Integration (internal cohesion of cultural concepts) and Socio-Cultural Integration (uptake of cultural concepts in society)</def>

Archeer makes four major criticisms of the original myth:
> -refusal to recognize or attach importance to inconsistencies within the cultural system; -inattention to the presence or absence of alternatives at the systemic level;
-unwillingness to concede any modicum of differentiation in the population;
-rejection of any condition capable of damaging socio-cultural integration. p.350
