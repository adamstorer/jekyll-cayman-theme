You try to control what your identity is. You can switch between identities, like acting differently on different forums. You can leave a social trace of that identity even if you leave. In this sense you are a "bundle of identities"

  Social organizations either black or allow action.
  >My central claim entails that the lives of these identities are stochas
tic flows over time whose primary shapers and switchers come from
the others, not just in local detail but also as overall patterns and dy
namics—as co-constituted context. It follows that blockage and getting
action provide the key contrast necessary for making sense of the com
plex arguments to follow. p.4

In otherwords, White claims that identity is really a social function, but a social function in a very contemporary sense - not in early constitution but in contemporary.

>Likely as not, the identity for a given child on this playground was
triggered from contingencies during play. The child’s identity links to
other identities in the playground through stories in that setting p.4

This is related to structural equivalence in networks.

>Disciplines are self-constituting conveners of social action, which
each induce an identity on a new level. In this book they are as im
portant as networks. Disciplines build around commitments that con
strain constituent identities, very different from networks with their
flexible sets of stories. Disciplines are concepts about processes rather
than about structure in sociocultural life. Depending on which disci
pline is at work, control struggles take place according to different
rules and in different frames. p. 8

There are three senses of identity:
1. A primordial need to understand social footing.
2. A group-level identity that can come along with a narrative about who "we" are
3. Understanding oneself in complex networks (frictions and errors across different social settings)
4. An ex post account of "who I am"
5. A dynamic, self-reproducing amalgam acrross profiles of switching in the first four.  On a distinct level from the others.

People make meaning when switching between different network theories.

White disallows the bracketing of context from identity.

The idea is that rational choice tries to explain away context, whereas structuralism explains away identity.

### Control and Social Space

Social space has different topologies. Dynamics of control also construct their own spaces.

>Insights about a topology suggest leverages for
control. For example, the military drill is one model of control, a model
that subjects to caricature the preconditions and steps for control. In a
drill, persons are induced to move in parallel within a little group
which is both literally and metaphorically cut off from other social rela
tions for a time. Alternatively, one can seek control from weaving a
maze of uncoordinated and changing contexts around others. Chapter
7 develops these themes. p.16

The general claim has three keys:
1. Divorce force from momentum...
2. Abstracting from particular objects to universals.
3. Move to a completely parameterized setting.

There are five theses:
1. Idntities emerge from turbulence seeking control from within social footings
2. Switching are the vehicles of meaning for identity and control
3. Switching reckons in change both of social relations and of domain of association
4. Context gains in depth as identities embed into new levels.
5. Context is constituted in and as patterns in dynamics across identities and control across levels for a situation.

# Chapter 7 - Getting Action

How do we get action?

Structure and fresh action presuppose each other and counter each other.

There is a moment of decoupling - when one acts in predictable ways and kinds of give up their identities? Like waiting in line or triage in a hospital. Networks dtermine what kidn of decoupling might occur. It is a design of context that is meant to produce an identity?


There are some groups that may try to maneouvre the future in some way. There can also be attempts for fresh control.

Disciplines suppress or transform contingencies, but enlarge the space for social action.

That is, discipline can pave the way for mobilization for truth.

Control over identity comes partially from some already constructed larger environment.

There is a pretty complex model here of how networks domains and disciplines can block or get action. The takeaway, I would say, of White's model is that - there is a sense in which role is inseparable from identity, and situations leave people in roles which either open or close opportunities for action. Situations are defined, and even in disciplining or blocking off certain cooridors situations are defined which open the possibility for new and different types of action.

One can try from above to get action, called "reaching down"

> An entrepreneur combining ownership and control to elide a level is getting action, but so is the same entrepreneur bringing in troubleshooting in various staff guises in order to scan and sample in testing for where a crisis is appearing or can be coaxed into existence. Identities would never have been triggered in th efirst place if there were no uncertainties, no contingencies. ONece formed, they encounter other identities, and each defines further contigencies for the others, eventuating in the full panopoly of ambage and ambiguity in addition.

One can also try to reach up (along some sort of power hierarchy) to get or block action.


Also, the more things cohere, the less likely you are to get creative action.

# Chapter 8 Overview and Contexts

White is asking: Where is the self? Where is consciousness? Who is doing all this thinking?

He sidelines the first two - but some people have problems with this

He argues that the person is really a byproduct rather than a generator of social process.

He is also interested in the compatability of his account witha ccounts of consciousness etc.

### Context

An idenitty triggers in its search for footing. Footing is reproduced in the context of nearby searcher by other identities. Space and time create interlocking locales which create some ties between ientities.

>Cultural cannot be disentagled from social: on the contrary, they intertwine in all perspectives, from netdom switchings to regime control or overturn. p. 337
