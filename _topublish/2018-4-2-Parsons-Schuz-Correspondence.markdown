## Parsons' Theory of Social Action: A Critical Review by Alfred Schutz

### Outstanding Features of Parsons' Theory

Common to all thinkers we have:
1. their general conception of the relationship between the theory of the social sciences and the empirical facts of social life
2. Their basic conceptual scheme of the theory of social sciences as a theory of social action
3. the principles of this theory of social action itself, voluntaristic theory.


#### Empirical Facts int he Social Sciences and in Everyday Life
>Within the scientific field there are no purely
empirical phenomena which are not referred to and modified
by an analytical theory. The facts do not tell their own
story; they must be cross-examined, analyzed, systematized,
compared, and interpreted p. 9

Facts must be interpreted within a theoretical system.
>All empirically verifiable
knowledge, therefore, involves implicitly, if not explic;
itly, systematic theory. Not only correct observation, but
also correct interpretation of the facts is the goal of scientific
activity, and interpretation already presupposes reference
to a theoretical scheme. p.9

There are social facts - and they have to be understood, interpreted as results of human activity and within the conceptual scheme of motives and goals

* But what, Schutz asks, about the division between common sense about social facts and scientific statements about social facts *

#### Theory of the Social Sciences as a Theory of Social Action

Everyone agrees that social science is a theory of action.

>To be sure, social
sciences applying, concretely, the scheme of the theory of
action deal also with constant data that are capable of description
but not of analytic explanation within the action
frame of reference.7 As Professor Parsons says, "physical"
phenomena as well as "ideas" are such data. p.11

WE are interessted in motive! We are interested in why people decide to do things. This is the voluntaristic theory of actions.

#### Parsons' Voluntaristic theory of action

Elements of the theory:
1. The act implies an agent, an 'actor'
2. The act has an end. There is a future orientation.
3. The act is initiated in a situation which is analyzable : there are conditions of which the actor has no control and means, which he has control
4. The act involves a certain mode of relationship with these elements, a normative orientation of action.

>To avoid any misunderstanding
it must be kept in mind that Parsons defines the term
"normative" with the purpose of eliminating legal and ethical
connotations: "A norm is a verbal description of the
concrete course of action thus regarded as desirable, combined
with an injunction to make certain future actions
conform to this course."p.13

Here are some of the implications:
1. An act is always processed in time in terms of an ends.
2. There is a range of choice open to the actor.
3. People's frame of reference is subjective.

There is a positivism in some of this that thinkers try to work around. Parsons uses an ultimate value system.

What of the unit acts, how are they joined together in a system of action?
>As certain degrees of complexity are reached, however,
an isolation of "descriptive aspects" may take place by
a kind of convenient "shorthand." Parsons distinguishes
two main directions of such descriptive aspects, which he
calls the "relational" and the "aggregational." The first,
used principally by Max Weber, consists in interpreting the
acts and action systems of different individuals under the
scheme of social relationships, the second in interpreting
the actor as a "theoretically relevant kind of person" with
particular character traits, particular attitudes and, going
one step further, in describing pluralities of actors as
groups p. 18

But can you break down the system into concretely separable threads?

In other words, to analyze a simple act you really need to have a deep understanding of the entire system.


WE have adistinction between unit analysis and element analysis. Systems of actions are composed of unit acts. Elements are the actors I think? Every unit is a combination of the elements.

>Its elements have causal significance in the sense
that variation in the value of any one has consequences for
the values of others. Above all, the means-end schema
becomes the central framework of the causal explanation of
action. Furthermore, it is the specific property of this
schema that it has a subjective reference. It involves a real
process in the mind of the actor as well as external to it. p.20

We hae three big systems - nature, culture, and action.
Within action we can get many different things.

## A Critical Examination of Parsons' Theory

>On the other hand, it
must be regretted that Professor Parsons intentionally renounces
the examination of the logical and philosophical
foundations upon which a correct methodology of the social
sciences must be based. It seems that an investigation of
these fundamental problems of knowledge would have contributed
a good deal toward greater clarity and coherence
in Professor Parsons' own important and interesting theory. p 22

Seven topic are to be discussed:

### Concrete and Analytical Levels i the Structure of Social Action

>On the concrete level all
systems of action can be broken down into unit acts with
concrete actors, concrete means and concrete ends. On the
analytical level, however, analysis leads to analytical elements,
to "universals." Moreover, on this level the action
scheme safeguarding the subjective point of view takes on
a different meaning from that which it has as a descriptive
schema; its elements have causal significance and it turns
out in the end that the action categories are not analytically
significant. p.23

There are some heterogenous ideas
1. Different levels in scientific analyses in general and in social sciences.

But we do have to leave some things, some levels aside to study a particular level.

But the necessity of leaving some things behind is problematic.
>On the contrary, it is possible
to prove the existence of very important interdependences
among all possible systems of questions and answers
and to show that there are certain key concepts the introduction
of which divides the formerly homogeneous field of
research into parts relevant or irrelevant to the topic under
consideration. p.24

#### Logicla Difference between independent parts and dependent factors

Can we break down a whole into parts which can exist independently? We do so with the unit analysis.

>The other consists in an abstract selection of
factors which have no real existence outside the objects
whose elements they are, as if I speak, for instance, of the
characteristics of a certain color. Green has its hue and
value, its chromatic characteristics without reference to the
green objects to which this color necessarily belongs. This
latter abstraction corresponds to Parsons' "element-analysis"
and he is quite correct in calling these elements "universals." p.24

But are they two different levels? IF  a level is a study of a problem then they are on the same level.

#### SUbjective and Objective POints of View

The subjective point is - what end did the indiividual wish to realize? It is a process within the person's mind.

>To anticipate some later results: its real significance
arises from the following dilemma. On the one
hand, it is correct that social phenomena, in order to be
understood, must be reduced to acts of human individuals;
on the other hand, several sciences dealing with social phenomena
(among them the most advanced disciplines such as
economics) can and do perform their tasks without entering
into analyses of individual or even collective acts. That situ
ation is indeed bewildering and requires a thorough explanation.
Parsons offers a solution, although an inconsistent
one. Another attempt to overcome this dilemma will be
presented later. p.25

### Voluntaristic Theory of Action and the Problem of Scientific Knowledge on the part of the Actor
>It must be assumed that his conception
of normativity implies an effort on the part of the actor
to accommodate his role as an agent to the teleological
value pattern, and that this appeal to the sphere of volition
has occasioned this rather strange term. p. 26

In the system, we have normative elements, elements which are integrated within the system itself. That is, ways that people approach action that are system-wide.

>All scientific knowledge presupposes
concepts and judgments, both of which have to be
formed with an optimum of clarity, distinctness, and precision.
None of these qualities are typical of every day's common-
sense thought. Its concepts are bound to the necessities
of a concrete and therefore very determined situation. They
are clear only in so far as the actor's interest requires that
a complex situation be elucidated p.27

Really this distinction is not so easy. But I am not sure about htat.
>To sum up we may state our question more precisely as
follows: Which of the elements pertaining to the action
frame of reference are really categories in the mind of the
actor and therefore subjective in the strict sense of this
term; which ones are merely appropriate schemes of interpretation
of the observer and, therefore, objective? Having
shown the category of scientifically verifiable knowledge to
be an objective one, we can go on to examine the concept of
normative values. And—anticipating the result—this category,
too, will reveal itself as a pure scheme of interpretation
and, therefore, as incompatible with the subjective
point of view. p.29

### Normative Values and MOtives

What is the normative value of action? It is subjective - but
>On the other hand, Professor Parsons
defines "norms" as verbal descriptions of a concrete course
of action combined with an injunction to make certain future
actions conform to this course. Presumably we have to
interpret this latter definition in the subjective sense: the
norm emerges in the mind of the actor demanding that its
command be realized. But even if such an interpretation
were admissible, there is obviously a great difference to be
observed.p.30

There is
1. an autonomous teleological element - one's onwn ideas
2. A heteronomous command - something set by someone else

That is, you can't ahve norms iwthotu people so you can't have subjective norms?

>topic. It is certainly strange that a theory of
action designed with such accuracy and care as that of
Professor Parsons should deal only superficially with the
problem of motives in social action. Only in his introductory
approach to the problem does he mention motives at all,53
stating that each actor in the social world, if asked to give
the meaning of his act, would enumerate certain motives.
Aside from this short remark motives are referred to only
once in the whole book, in his discussion of Weber's theory
of "motivationally adequate understanding."64 It must be
presumed that Parsons intentionally neglected this side of
the theory of action. p.32

What would a tehory of motives need?

We distinguish between action and behavior - action is a project which preces it in time. Really all motives are part of the larger system. Schutz is concerned with being able to describe all things from the subjects point of view, rather than bringing in norms which presuppose a system we don't understand.

>. He replaces
subjective events in the mind of the actor by a scheme of
interpretation for such events, accessible only to the observer,
thus confusing objective schemes for interpreting
subjective phenomena with these subjective phenomena
themselves. As a conscientious and extraordinarily subtle
thinker, he recognizes that there must be a "certain mode
of relationship" between the elements of the unit act, i.e.,
between the actor, the end of action and the situation itself.
But he does not ask about the subjective structure of such
a relationship which would have led him to study the system
of motives. He fills the gap by introducing normative
values, which give indeed a very helpful scheme for interpreting
the motives of social action and are applied with the
greatest success by many renowned sociologists p.36


Parsons is interested in developing a scheme from an objective point of view, rather than understanding the subjective point of view.

### The Limits of the Unit Act
Parsons has four characteristics of a unit act:
1. a given actor
2. a given end
3. a given situation
4. a given normative value orientation as teh relationship between those other elemnts.

But these shift in meaning depending on whether we are objective or subjective.

If we take every day into account there are kind of everyday habits with constant ends. Then there are long term projects lie writing a book.

>As we said before, it is the system of life-plans
which determines the full meaning of the concrete act for
the actor. Therefore, this meaning itself changes with the
continuous modification of the whole system. Secondly, the
system of life-plans is only partially known to the actor in
its fully explicit form and is only partially caught by the ray
of actual attention and thereby rendered relevant. In any
given moment, there is a brightly illuminated nucleus surrounded
by a horizon of growing darkness. p.40

So really when does an act start?

>Consequently, all the features characterizing the unit act
according to Professor Parsons' description are genuinely
subjective terms, interpretable and understandable above
all from the subjective point of view, and suffering a shift
in meaning when transposed into the realm of objectivity.
Concerning the term "end" this thesis is, we suppose, selfexplanatory.
Only the actor knows the real end, or better,
the real goal of his action. The observer can never decide
whether what he considers to be an end is such for the actor,
too, or only an intermediate end, a means, therefore, for the
realization of the ultimate goal included within the span of
the actor's project. p.41

WE can really say the same thing about actor as we can about action. We have a legaal self, right? Perhaps there are several selves.

### The Subjective Point of View in the Social Science

WE are saying science is objective but it isn't. We are subjectivities doing science.

Behavioralists restrict themselves to only thinign about behavior, thus producing an objectivity out of subjectivity.

>In this case, the answering of our question, "What does
this social world mean for me, the observer?", has as a
prerequisite the answering of the quite different questions,
"What does this social world mean for the observed actor
within this world, and what did he mean by his acting
within it?" With these questions we no longer naively accept
the social world and its current idealizations and formalizations
as ready-made and meaningful beyond all
doubt, but undertake to study the process of idealizing and
formalizing as such, the genesis of the meaning which social
phenomena have for us as well as for the actors, the mechanism
of the activity by which human beings understand one
another and themselves. p.48

### Types and REality
>In other words, the scientific observer decides to study the
social world within an objective or a subjective frame of
reference. This decision delimits from the beginning that
section of the social world (or, at least, the aspect of such a
section) which becomes capable of being studied once that
scheme has been chosen. p.49

We each have some set of natural things that we think of as natural, and social things which are the product of humanity. We each have our own understanding of these which is limited. Within these limits we make predictions. Understanding natural things and understanding social things means something very different, because it's hard to make predictions about social things.

>Summing up, we come
to the conclusion that social things are understandable only
if they can be reduced to human activities; and human activities
can be made understandable only by showing their
in-order-to or because motives. This fact has its deeper reason
in that I am able to understand other people's acts while
living naively in the social world only if I can imagine that
I myself would perform analogous acts if I were in the same
situation as the Other, directed by the same because motives
or oriented by the same in-order-to motives—all these
terms understood in the restricted sense of a "typical" analogy,
a "typical" sameness, as explained above. p.53


For instance, when I ask a question i predict that you will answer. We have a theory of how your and my motives interact ina  situation. s

>The social world in which I live as one connected with
others through manifold relations is for me an object to be
interpreted as meaningful. It makes sense to me, but by the
same token I am sure it makes sense to Others too. I suppose,
furthermore, that my acts, oriented to Others, will be
understood by them in a way analogous to the way I understand
the acts of Others oriented to me. More or less naively
I presuppose the existence of a common scheme of reference
for both, for my own acts and the acts of Others. I am
interested above all not in the overt behavior of Others, not
in their performance of gestures and bodily movements, but
in their intentions, and this means I am interested in the
in-order-to motives for the sake of which Others act as they
do, and in the because motives based on which they act as
they do. p.55

We try to undeerstand the meaning of others actions.

### Social Life and Social theory

It is hard to leave your subjectivity and be a social scientist.

This seems to be done by creating ideal types. One creates types through observation. That is, we are creating models of actors and institutions. These ideal types in some way solve some of the problems by dealing not with others and subjectivities but with ideal type modelsof human interaction.

# Parsons Reply

Three reasons why he doens't buy it.

1. A misunderstanidng of the argument. Schutz says that in moving from unit to element analysis, you end up seeing that action categories are not important. But this is not what he meant. This was a case of a "positivist" rather than a "voluntaristic" system.
2. The foci of interests are quite different. Schutz is approaching things espistemologically. Instead parsons is interested in scientific theory. That is, what people find versus how they think.
>The general impression, however, is that you
are simply not interested in what I call theory as distinct
from methodology, and that your thinking does not run in
those lines. In a sense, this is, of course, a matter of interpretation,
but a much more generalized and subtle aspect of it
than those I called attention to above

In other words, Schutz is not really engaging with the theory as such, and rather arguing about its basis.

3. It is too philosophical a problem of methodological justification.
>A critic is, it seems to me, entitled to do one
of two things. He may radically question the general position
I have taken and maintain, for instance, that for a
scientific conceptual scheme to enjoy any sort of validity it
must assume a kind of ontological status which I refuse to
grant it. If, on the other hand, he does not wish to do this,
he may attempt to show in detail that proper consideration
of certain specific philosophical problems would alter the
specific treatment of specific theoretical issues in specific
ways. p.66

He is not engaging with the actual theory of action.
>Your argument seems to presuppose that there is a kind of
distinction between (1) that which is originally given in
experience, (2) the interpretation of this given material, and
(3) statements about this. I think these distinctions, while
they are valid for certain purposes, are apt to be unrealistic.
Actually the role of the conceptual scheme is only analytically
distinguishable from given experience. We always observe,
i.e. we experience, in terms of a conceptual scheme.
Furthermore, precisely because and insofar as experience is
conceptualized it is a matter of statements or propositions. p.68


>fundamentally. I am furthermore inclined to think
that the primary reason why you have misunderstood me is
your complete failure to think in terms of the logic of theoretical
systems. What I mean by the analytic level is the set
of logical considerations that are involved in the statement
of the problem of determination of the state of a system as
a whole. It is the level that is presupposed in the statement
of a system of differential equations in mechanics. Confusion
of this level with that which I call the concrete level is
a source of difficulty of the first importance in the history
of the theory of action. p.74

## One more letter on phenomenological analysis

>The only thing I would want to remark
beyond this in this connection is that the problem of integration
of the total action system of an individual is logically
distinct from the problem of defining the elements of
a unit act. One of the most important sources of irrationality
lies in defects of integration, which in turn have many
different causes. p.79

>I am quite willing to grant that legal or other norms, once
institutionalized, have a status for the concrete actor which
is closely analogous to that of nonhuman conditions. Disobedience
to these involves consequences beyond the control of
the actor, the probability of which he must take into account.
But this is a consequence of institutionalization and
cannot be treated as a primary fact for analytic purposes
without involving circular reasoning. This becomes perhaps
particularly conspicuous when you include other-worldly
sanctions as consequences of disobedience. Surely the automatic
consequences of sin in the form of hell-fire, as conceived
by a ''hard-shelled" Baptist, are not of the same order
as the consequences to an automobile driver of not keeping
on the road. p. 80

He is not interested in the psychology of choice, but the different relating elements.

>I think, that is, that what is to me your
untenable antithesis between naive common sense and scientific
knowledge is also involved here. I think there is a far
closer relation between our meaningful interpretations of
the future and the past than you seem to. In both connections
there is, of course, enormous variation in precision,
self-consciousness, and so on. p.83

>decided. I quite radically
disagree with your view that the subdivisions of systems
are in a natural sense present in the mind of the actor
but are not accessible to the observer. There are unquestionably
many cases where it is possible for an observer, with
the proper skills and the opportunities, to know a great deal
more about an actor in many respects than he can know
about himself. Above all, what the actor does self-consciously
know about himself is not somehow an immediate
reflection of an ontological reality but is just as much mediated
through a conceptual scheme and hence selected as
to fact and selectively organized as what an observer knows
about another. p.84

On the objective/subjective distinction:

>I think what you mean essentially is an ontological
reality, what a concrete real actor "really" experiences.
I think I have legitimate reasons to be skeptical that
by your analysis or by any others available it is possible to
arrive at anything approaching a definitive description of
such a reality. I am afraid I must confess to being skeptical
of phenomenological analysis. But however that may be, I
mean something quite different.
I mean a set of categories for the description and analysis
of the empirical phenomenon of human action, a set of categories
involving a frame of reference which has the same
order of significance and is put to the same kind of uses as
is a frame of reference in any empirical science. From my
point of view, the antithesis you draw between the objective
and subjective points of view is unreal. There is no such
thing as a body of knowledge or scientifically relevant experience
which represents the "pure" subjective point of view.
Subjective phenomena have meaning only as described and
analyzed by an observer. p.88


>I insist continuously on the use of the subjective point of
view, but in the form of subjective categories in a conceptual
scheme and not in the form of an account of what the subjective
social world "really" is. I think subjective categories in
this sense are always involved in any description of social
phenomena which does not reduce it to what are actually
biological or physical terms. p. 90

## Schutz Reply

>The great difficulty, I feel, consists in the relation
between cultural systems and action. I agree fully with you
that cultural systems may be considered as products of processes
of action. But these systems of culture furnish the
best example of a field open to element analysis where the
action categories are not analytically significant. I think
that the same can be asserted quite generally for all products
of human action. I can always consider them in terms
of the action frame of reference, but there is an analytical
level where the action element drops out, and that is always
the case if I am examining the products of action as such,
without including in my scope the acts which produced
them. p.100

>Your second general comment on my paper is that our
problems are quite different, as you are interested first of all
in a generalized system of scientific theory whereas you feel
that I am primarily studying methodological and epistemological
problems. I do not think that such a difference really
does exist between our goals and I feel quite strongly that
there is here a difference in terminology—rather than in
thought. p.101

>I think that your analyses are not
radical enough first of all as far as the subjective point of
view is concerned and that you take for granted many phenomena
which need further examination. As examples I
want to state that nowhere in your own theory do you deal
with the specific social categories of acting and mutual interaction,
with the problem of the frame of reference relative
to the alter ego towards which the actor's own actions
are oriented and within which the alter ego interprets the
actor's action; that all your statements concerning the
structure of the act are applicable as well to the act of the
solitary actor as to the act oriented towards and motivated
by an alter ego; that, consequently, you have disregarded
the vital importance of the time element in all human action
and the differences between the logical significance of
an act already performed and an act just projected and, on
the other hand, the categories of personality and
anonymity; that, in particular, you do not explain the specific
attitude the social scientist has to adopt towards the
social world, which is an attitude derived from that of the
partner in the social world, but with quite other "operational
signs" or "subscripts" which bestow in both cases a
different meaning upon any interpretation of an alter ego's
act; that hence your theory of values as well as the role you
attribute to science is acceptable only if you forego the explanation
of the problems of intersubjectivity involved in
both and if you presuppose the whole social world with all
its structural differentiations just as given, allowing "values"
and "science" to enter your system dvpaOev "through
the door" if I may use this Aristotelian term. p.104

Schutz wants a radical analysis of social intersubjectivity, the ways in which people are understanding each other and working together, whereas parsons wants a subjectivity that is not committed to the complexities of an intersubjective understanding. Parson's model of action is not concerned with a DYAD, but scaling an individual from acting alone to acting in social situations.
