# Network Sampling

How much of the network are we interested in capturing? Just a dyad?  
* Ego Network
  - Focal Node and All Directly Connected Alters
* Sub-Groups
  - Attribute Based Groups
* Ego _ N-Steps
  - Link Tracing
* Complete Network
  - The entire population of nodes we have within some boundary

  ## Ego Network Designs
  * Data - Ego and Alters
  * Usually start with a name generator - a means for identifying what you're looking for
  * The important matters question

  ## Complete Network Designs
  * Identify complete population boundary

  ## Partial Network Designs
  * Common for hard to identify populations
    - You start with a sample of seeds, and then turn their named partners to additional respondents.

# GSS PErsonal Networks Name Generator
People name close to 0, but it seems like people maybe have 290 or more.
* There are also anme interpreters where we follow up to make sense of the characteristic of the relationships
* We can think more about the attributes of the alters - if we want to know who they're connected to, we need to get as much info as possible from the respondents.
* What are the relationships among alters? And then we get deep into that
* There is something like "Network Canvas" where people can name their friends and how they fit together - but what really does one get out of this?

But how many name generators are we using? There are different types of relationships among students - so this is kind of relational stuff. But we often don't get the kind of stuff that we really want to be getting.

* You can also cap the number of alters? Should you? YOu can create a ceiling or floor effect

* The different size of the alter set that you use can lead to a different interpretation fo th enetwork data
* Maybe you should ask a lot because when you name you start with a small cluster, and then you get one but not the other

# Other Considerations?
* Specificity vs Generality Consideration - How specific do you want people to be about the time window? What is the denominator - how many people do you possibly talk with?

* Free Recall vs Roster Based - are you checking off? WHat's the tradeoff?
