# Culture and Organization

Things seem relaxed at the Tech Company, but they aren't really. There is a cleqr management style. But everything is culturally strange, people care about slideshows, call things modules, etc.

What do they see as tech's culture?
1. Social characteristics of the company that specify behavior - lack of structure, hard work
2. Deeper rules about family mindsets and religion.
3. Technical rules about what accomplishment looks like.

And there is more, a dual nature:
1. Implicit and explicit rules that guide and shape their behavior at work
2. A vehicle through which they consciously try to influence the behavior and experience of others.

For tech managers, they use culture to make people want to do things. So, work in companies imbued with personal significance, you shape the ways in which people find things rewarding. That is, there is a conflict of interest between management and workers, and culture is meant to downplay this difference.

Kunda draws on Etzioni's notion of normative control - the attempt to elicit and direct efforts by controlling the underlying experiences, thoughts, and feelings that guide their actions.

Kunda asks:
>Thus, understanding the practical consequences of the ideology of normative
control in bureaucratic settings becomes a matter of acute importance.
How effective, we must ask, are the corporate attempts to influence employees?
What is the experience of the people against whom such heavy claims
are made? What kind of people are produced in this process? In short, if
the member role represents normative demands, what are the normative
responses and how are we to evaluate them? p. 14

There is a positive side that people see as well as a dark side.

So, Kunda studies tech culture in order to understand its effects on the people.

>Thus, to begin to evaluate strong cultures in the workplace it is necessary
to go beyond free-floating rhetoric to the people who live with these
cultures and to the everyday lives in the course of which ideas are formed,
presented, and put into effect. Culture, in short, must be studied in context
and the entire normative transaction examined: managerial conceptions of
the culture. their enactment, and the responses of members. p. 23

In a sense, we are not understanding culture, but the ways in which managers manipulate culture, and we attempt to understand the manipultion and its effects on people.


# Chapter 3 - Ideology: Tech Culture Codified

Workers see talk about culture a lot in tech. We see a well-articulated, thought out organizatioanl ideology.

>Ideology, most generally speaking. is an authoritative system of meaning.'
As Geertz (1973: 220) suggests, all ideologies-whether political,
aesthetic, moral, or economic-are "schematic images of social order"
publicly offered in the name of those with a claim to authority as "maps
of problematic social reality and matrices for the creation of collective conscience." p.52


 Direct voice of authority - The company philosophy, the introduction tape, other things like that.

### Top Management
We see organizational ideology in official statements that higlight certain things like honesty, quality, profit etc. Also, we see talks by senior managers.
>Overall. the managerial perspective depicts Tech as an organic community
with a history, a mission, and shared values. Not surprisingly, "technology"
and "business" goals provide the ultimate sources of meaning.
More crucially, the two are compatible in the service of a higher goal-
"making a social contribution." It is suggested that the blend is unique to
Tech. Internally, the company is presented as possessing a "people orientation,"
combining paternal care with an open, informal, yet achievementoriented
society lacking the trappings of status-conscious and rule-bound
bureaucracies. In such an environment, organizational action is based on
principles of individualism: autonomy of action, freedom, and initiative. At
the same time, accountability and responsibility are enforced, not only by
one's superiors but also by peers, who are the source of intellectual challenge p. 67

There is no contradiction between personal and collective goals, because individualism is the key to membership. Also, membership is somewhat undifferentiated.

### Staff - The Voice of Expertise

These are inernal experts - members of staff groups, consultants, or those on temporary assignment. These people are "culture experts"

>For example, a paper titled "Talking Values: Heroes of Engineering Speak"
attempts to breath life into abstract principles by offering members' testimonials
to their own real-life experiences. Framed as "a study of Tech
values." it consists of excerpts from interviews with senior Tech managers
and engineers identified as "heroesn-successful manifestations of the culture.
One interviewee suggests that the formal "company philosophy" is a
valid description of Tech and its members p.72

### Tech Watchers - Voice of Objectivity

Here we have the academics, the researchers in business schools etc.

>Such academic studies maintain the appearance of neutrality based on a
scientific descriptive stance. Their main claim is that member behavior is
driven by an orientation to the company based on an identification with the
collective that, in turn, is achieved through incorporation of "the culture."
The boundaries between self and company are blurred, and attachment has
an emotional component. The focus is on the professional and managerial
employees as natural representatives of the collective. p.79

Also journalists.

The three of these together suggest that there is significant effort that goes into shaping organizational ideology.

>Internally, Tech's distinct principles of organization are captured in the
notion of "culture" as opposed to "structure." Traditional forms of control
associated with bureaucracy are relegated to a supporting role. Instead,
control is thought of as the internalization of discipline reflected in the attitudes,
orientations, and emotions of committed members. The company is
presented as informal and flexible, and its management as demanding yet
trusting. The community is characterized as "bottom-up," loose, free, a
"people company." p.90

# Presentational Rules  Talking Ideology

Presentation rituals are pervasive

There is a performance rituals (talks) which essentially tells people how ot think.

However, tech rituals are decentralized - people may grab power relatively easily. Symbolic power is also subtle, people are forced to do things in a way that is more like a pull than a push.

>The most dominant response to the exertion of symbolic power in the context
of ritual life at Tech is the expression of role embracement: participants
express their acceptance of the member role, including not only the prescribed
behaviors but, more crucially, the beliefs one must espouse and the
emotions one is to experience and display. p.156

Maybe this is due to Hochschild's deep acting. Though there may be some emotive dissonance.

>watching." Expressed differently in
the various ritual forms-subtle and controlled in top management presentations,
aggressive and critical in training workshops, widespread and playful
in work group meetings-the liminal mode provides an alternative reality:
participants temporarily detach themselves from their performance of the
member role, comment on it, and share with others the awareness, either
cheerful or disdainful, of the theatrical nature of the proceedings. Thus, the
liminal stages of Tech rituals differ from liminality as Turner depicted it: it
is not the meaning of hierarchy (who is up and who is down) so much as the
meaning of authenticity (who is "real" and who is not) and inclusion (who
is "in" and who is "out") that is being enacted. p.158

That is, if there is some deep acting, it is in making sense of the liminality of their beliefs within the role they're being put in.

>Thus, ritual life at Tech is composed of a paradoxical, counterpunctual
weaving of common sense, ideology, and the experiences associated with
them that brings to the attention of participants a complex, multifaceted,
and ambiguous reality. Participants are systematically presented with an explicit
awareness of the dramatic mechanisms that underlie the process of
framing reality, and an open acknowledgment of the manufactured nature of
cultural categories and symbols, including those that are central to the ritual
performance itself.j2 A self-consciousness that could be considered a fatal
flaw in the ritual performances now becomes its central theme and is itself
highly ritualized. p. 159

So we could have role embracement adn role distancing?

# Self and Organization

>The organizational self is formed in transaction with the ideologically prescribed
member role and the demands it makes on the members' experience.
By omission or commission, thought, word, or deed, participants explicitly
or tacitly choose a stance toward what is attributed to them; in this process,
they define, interpret, and display their understanding of the social environment,
their personal experience, and the relationship between the two.  p. 214

For marginal members who are not subjected to all the demands of the member role, those who are low status find themselves having fewer demands on the self. (contractors etc)

For full members, the extensive demands provide a deilemna - The higher up you rise in the system the more you are faced with the ideology of tech culture. One must show htemselves to be behaviorally the same as other high status members. It seems as though the price of power is submission.

>In short, inherent in a system of normative control is a contradiction between
the requirements of internal and external control of the self. This
causes members to experience what Merton (1957: 6) refers to as "sociological
ambivalence-a condition that results from "incompatible normative
expectations of attitudes, beliefs and behaviors assigned to a status or a set
of statuses in society." p. 227

There is a mess of attractiveness and repulsiveness to the companies demands.

So it is n ot really a continuance of attachment or detachment to the role. For higher status members we see both attachment adn detachment.

>We have come full circle. If the attempt to engineer culture and accomplish
normative control is aimed at defining the members' selves for them,
this very attempt undermines its own assumptions. The engineers of culture
see the ideal member as driven by strong beliefs and intense emotions,
authentic experiences of loyalty, commitment, and the pleasure of work.
Yet they seem to produce members who have internalized ambiguity, who
have made the metaphor of drama a centerpiece of their sense of self, who
question the authenticity of all beliefs and emotions, and who find irony
in its various forms the dominant mode of everyday existence.'' In short,
when the contested terrain, to use Edwards' (1979) term, is the self, the terrain
itself is transformed and perhaps deformed: the unremitting glare of the
ideological spotlight degrades that experience which, perhaps, can flourish
only uncontested, in the dark. p. 216


# Conclusion

>Wage Class 4 comprises full
members, citizens in good standing of the corporate community. As such,
they are clearly both subjects and agents of normative control and primary
participants in Tech's cultural life and the rituals associated with it. Members
of the other two groups regard the applicability of the organizational
ideology to themselves with some skepticism. Despite the prevalent rhetoric
of normative control, there appears to be a clear contradiction between
the reality they live with and its ideological representation. Wage Class 2
employees are subjected to a system of utilitarian control based mainly on
economic incentives, while temporary workers work under conditions closer
to what Etzioni (1961) referred to as coercive control: they are subject to
immediate termination and possess no rights as employees. Thus, one consequence
of the managed culture is a polarization of central and marginal
members: the former must accept or limit an extensively defined organizational
self; the latter must live with or seek to enlarge a minimal one p. 221


>The second consequence involves the impact of normative control on its
main targets: members of Wage Class 4. As Chapter 5 shows, their experience
is characterized by "sociological ambivalence": as members move in
and aspire to increased centrality and higher status, they are also increasingly
subjected to normative control and threatened with a loss of personal
autonomy. Responses to this dilemma, described in detail in Chapter 5 , are
based on the attempt to balance self and role under conditions where equilibrium
is hard, if not impossible, to sustain. Thus, the central experience of
membership is not only that which the ideology seeks to instill, but also the
experience of struggle with it. In this sense. members have internalized the
"problem of control" that lies at the heart of organization, and the private
selves of members have become part of the "contested terrain." p. 221
