title:  "Patterson - Making Sense of Culture"

Abstract: "I present a brief review of problems in the sociological study of culture, followed by an integrated, interdisciplinary view of culture that eschews extreme contextualism and other orthodoxies. Culture is defined as the conjugate product of two reciprocal, componential processes. The first is a dynamically stable process of collectively made, reproduced, and unevenly shared knowledge structures that are informational andmeaningful, internally embodied, and externally represented and that provide predictability, coordination equilibria, continuity, and meaning in human actions and interactions. The second is a pragmatic component of culture that grounds the first, and it has its own rules of usage and a pragmatically derived structure of practical knowledge. I also offer an account of change and draw on knowledge activation theory in exploring the microdynamics of cultural practice and propose the concept of cultural configuration as a better way of studying cultural practice in highly heterogeneous modern societies where people shift between multiple, overlapping configurations."

Basically sociology of culture is difficult and there is fighting about it everywhere. The worst part is that everyone is always trying to carve out new agendas.

## Divisions in Cultural Sociology

Patterson argues here are three divisions in cultural sociology particularly with respect to meaning.
1. Sociocultural approach - the focus is on cultural knowledge structures and their uses in given social contexts. Meaning is something that is conveyed or signified in a fairly transparent way, like in Berger and Luckman.  
2. Meaning as subjective and instersubjective understanding - understanding how someone understands or makes sense of themselves and their world regardless of its objective validity.  Here Patterson argues:
>It
is arguable whether the act of interpretation,
expected of most analysts, does not distort and
misrepresent the understandings being conveyed,
an issue that led Bourdieu to scour such
studies, including phenomenological attempts
to resolve the matter p. 4

3. Cultural and Social Semiotics - The study of language, symbols, rituals, metaphors, codes, etc. These semiotic studies also have many divisions, flowing from Geertz, maybe Focuault? The second comes from American Pragmatism. The third is from Durkheim and Mauss as well as early Bourdieu.

## Assumptions and Propositions

For Patterson culture is two interconnected components. The basic processes are shared and internally embodied and externally represented. This is the predictable level which human interaction requires to do some sort of shared meaning.

But while culture is predictable, it is also dynamic. Therefore it makes sense to study somewhat smaller cultural configurations rather than large cultural formations. For instance, it's a bit difficult to study something like american culture.
