## Chapter One
>Not Under My Roof will take us beyond our usual perspectives on adolescent
sexuality.2 Medical and public health literatures conceptualize adolescent
sexuality primarily in terms of individual risk-taking and the factors
that augment or lessen such risks.3 American developmental psychologists
tend to view adolescent sexuality as part of adolescents’ separation from
their parents and as an aspect of development that is especially perilous
given the disjuncture between teenagers’ physical and cognitive development. p. 2

In American society even after the sexual revolution feelings about kids ssex lives remain mixed. In the Netherlands, people are ok with things like having their daughters boyfriend sleep over.

>Emphasis on the positive aspects of sex and relationships—within the
context of respect for self and others—is a key feature of Dutch sex education.
Although they set national “attainment targets,” Dutch policymakers
avoided political controversy over sex education by delegating the task of
reaching agreements on the content and delivery of sex education to professionals.
48 Sociologists Jane Lewis and Trudie Knijn have argued that like
Dutch policymakers, Dutch sex educators have accepted teenage sexual exploration,
viewing it as the result of societal changes p.9

So what explains the difference?
1. Americans arew more religious
2.  the Dutch have accept to free contraceptives and abortions.

But even so, there is also a cultural explanation.

3. From Gender Scholars - Adolescent sexuality is a part of the expression and transition of gender inequality.

>But the gender inequality perspective also does not solve the puzzle,
for while it helps explain why many girls in the United States experience
a lack of physical pleasure as well as negative emotions about sex, especially
when sex happens outside of a steady relationship, it does not account
for the ambivalence and misgivings that many American boys also
report. Nor does it account for the similarity in Dutch surveys in boys’ and
girls’ reports of wanting, feeling control over, and enjoying fi rst sexual experiences.
Moreover, it offers no explanation for why, unlike the American
parents interviewed for this book, the Dutch parents do not talk about gender
as a salient feature of teenage sex and relationships, and why they are
just as likely to permit daughters as sons to spend the night together with
steady boy- and girlfriends. p.12

4. Foucault Style Explanation - There is some strange power of discipline and discourse.

But why have different discourses cometo prevail?

### Culture
She takes a synthetic appraoch to culture:
1. How peopel conceputalize themselves
2. The controlling component of culture
3. The constitutive component of culture.

>Culture is, at least in part, national.72 Nations provide people with
distinctive conditions and resources for shared meaning-making. Transnational
economic and political processes notwithstanding, cultural processes
are still shaped by nation-specifi c political, economic, and cultural
institutions. National policies draw on cultural ideals and categories and,
in turn, inform perceptions and experiences.73 Cultural products—elite and
popular—both refl ect and shape broader national cultures. But national
differences in culture are not just products of current conditions. More important
are cultural concepts and practices that originate in, among others,
formative geo-political events, geographic conditions, and religious traditions,
and that persist after their original impetus has either mutated or
been lost.74 Language and rituals—everyday and exceptional—are both repositories
of cultural concepts and means to communicate and enact them. p.15

There are different processes at play, the Americans dramatize while the Dutch normalize.
There are also different types of individualism, in the united states it is adversarial (the individual and society stand opposed to one another) in the Netherlands it is interdependent (individual and society are muchually constitutive.)

>Each version of individualism has been accompanied by a distinct form
of social control: Adversarial individualism permits, encourages even, individuals
to attain autonomy by breaking away from social ties and dependencies,
and only after that break form intimate relationships. However,
because this defi nition of autonomy necessitates a disruption of social
connectedness, it makes it diffi cult to envision social cohesion and selfrestraint
without some higher authority. Thus ironically, adversarial individualism
calls for the use of overt external control, especially against those
who have not (yet) attained full autonomy. Interdependent individualism,
by contrast, encourages individuals to develop their autonomy in concert
with ongoing relationships of interdependence. p.18

This also leads to different notions of gender.

>The American parents often
mention differences and confl icts of interest between girls and boys. In
fact, in some, though certainly not most, families, the American boys report
receiving implicit or explicit encouragement from fathers to pursue
sexual interests. And while the interpretation and management of sexuality
in American middle-class families led both girls and boys to use sex as a
vehicle to engage in a psychology of separation, bifurcating sexuality and
family life, this process tends to take a greater psychological toll on girls.
While boys are expected to be “bad,” girls are encouraged to be “good.” p.21

## Chapter 2

Even when dutch parents are uncomfortablewith Sex, they do not say "do not do it." The doctors actual recommend refraining from this. There is a normalization of adolescent sexuality in the netherlands. They also think about relationship-based sexuality and self-regulated sexuality.

Sometimes DUtch parents walk around naked. The only problem is, I am not sure you can locate some meaningful difference in the way people actively conceptualize things, because the process should just as easily work completely under the hood. Also, the children are supposed to regulate themselves.

>We have seen that three cultural frames interact to create a web of meaning
and feeling that gives the practice of the sleepover its cognitive, emotional,
and moral sense.14 The fi rst is normal sexuality: the sexuality of teenagers
can and ideally should be talked about and dealt with in an open, frictionless,
and matter-of-fact manner. Things sexual, including bodies and their
functions, should inspire as little discomfort or turmoil as talk about what
and when to eat. The second is relationship-based sexuality: sexual desire
and sexual acts grow out of a teenager’s feelings for and relationship with
another person. Finally, self-regulated sexuality dictates that readiness for
sex is a moment when emotional and physical desires are united and sensible
preventative measures are taken p.41

Even here it is not always like that.

## Chapter 3

American parents are less accepting. ALso, their notions are much more gendered.

>If American parents do not exert as deep a control as their Dutch peers,
they are also more constrained in the support they can offer by cultural
templates that construct sex as a battle between parents and teens, girls and
boys, and different parts of the self p. 57

Americans blame things on raging hormones. Also on the different desires of boys and girls. This is called dramatization.

There are also two types of control - overt control - you may not do this (dramatization/american way) and deep control (i am controling the way that you think/dutch way)

Even liberal maerican parents who would be allowed to have a sleepover, but still has feelings of violence and fear about other things.

>By no stretch of the imagination a social conservative, Dierdre nevertheless
articulates the belief that the loosening of the old restrictions has
done damage to intimate relations and girls’ safety. In this regard, she is
hardly unique. Unlike their Dutch counterparts who, reservations about
sexuality becoming too gewoon notwithstanding, tend to embrace the gains
of normalization, the American parents speak with greater ambivalence
about the changes in sexuality and society that have taken place during
and since their youth. Their accounts show how the drama of adolescent
sexuality in the United States, like its normalization in the Netherlands, is
constituted in relation to personal and societal histories. p. 71

This is becaue, I think, there are more STDs.?

>This disconnect is partially historically constituted. Unlike the Dutch,
who responded to the sexual revolution with a normalization of adolescent
sexuality, grounded in and predicated on a shared ethics of selfregulation
and interpersonal attunement, many American parents, even
those who partook in the sexual revolution wholeheartedly, seem to have
emerged from the pivotal decades of 1960s and 1970s more lost than
found. Amidst a society that was becoming painfully reconfi gured, many
American parents experienced or saw the pursuit of pleasure—sexual and
otherwise—run amok. And without having apparently found a new, postsexual-
revolution basis for social bonds, they became skeptical of adolescent
intimacy and the institutions that shape it. In the absence of faith in
new forms of self-mastery, intimacy, and societal cohesion, parents draw
in their moment of need—when asked about what makes sex right for
youth—on narratives more suited to a 1950s biography than to the lives
their children are living.17 p.75

## Chapter Four

There are differnet types of individualism - adversarial and independent.
>The previous two chapters have left us with a puzzle: the American and
Dutch white middle-class parents I interviewed—who resemble one another
closely in terms of age, occupation, and education—nonetheless differ
dramatically in how they understand and respond to the sexual maturation
of their teenage children. Dutch parents construct a nonproblematic,
non-emotionally disruptive, and decidedly relationship-based adolescent
sexuality. American parents, by contrast, construct adolescent sexuality as
dangerous, confl icted, and deeply polarized. The difference between the
American drama and the Dutch “normality tale” crystallizes around one
striking contrast: a high-school-aged teen spending the night with a boy- or
girlfriend at home is potentially permissible to nine out of ten Dutch parents,
while this practice strikes nine out of ten American parents as beyond
the pale, and even, quite frankly, as ludicrous. p.77

The reasoning for this goes all the way back to the 60's and 70's and different accounts of individualism.

Adversarial Individualism has the following responses.
1. Alcohol - Impulse-driven teenagers require external control.
2. Adulthood - Requires self-sufficiency
3. Auhoriy - Winning importnat battles, letting go of small things

Interdependent Individualism is different
1. Alcohol - Socially embedded teenagers develop internal control.
2. Adulthood - Requires self-regulation
3. Authority - Continuous mutual agreement.

These three things are the adolescent parenting project and the responses by nation.

There are also differences in self-sufficiency and what it means to be an adult. For America it means making money, for the dutch it means making coffee for yourself etc.

>Built on longstanding cultural traditions, the two cultures of individualism
forged nationally specifi c interpretations and experiences of
the challenges to traditional sexual, gender, and authority relations. In the
United States, the individualism of the post-1960s era built on a tradition
of viewing the self as autonomous from others and social ties as matters
of choice rather than necessity. Yet, these concepts of self and the social
also made self-restraint and social bonds seem fragile when the institutions
that had instilled order were changing. In the Netherlands, by contrast,
lay individuals, scholars, and commentators could embrace growing
self- determination because they still conceived of the self as embedded in a
sociality where mutual attunement instills individual and societal order.
The Dutch and American parents who came of age during the 1960s
and ’70s illuminate these adversarial and interdependent individualisms that
are products of the confl uence of change and continuity p.104s

## Conclusion
>Dutch middle-class parents normalize adolescent
sexuality, permitting teenagers to spend the night at home with
girl- and boyfriends, while American parents dramatize adolescent sexuality,
and, with few exceptions, oppose teenage couples spending the night
together. One reason the two sets of parents view and manage teenage sexuality
differently is that they draw on different models of modern individualism:
given their different assumptions about (self-) control, autonomy,
and authority, it makes sense to American parents to view teenage sexuality
as a potential drama in the making, while to Dutch parents the “normality
tale” is both plausible and desirable. p.181

Teenagers idffer in some aspects from their parents, but dutch teenagers experience less conflict. But why is the American view of freedom so disciplinary?
>Comparing dramatization and normalization—
and the different individualisms in which they are based—shows, in turn,
how Foucault’s argument about the effectiveness of modern power misses
critical pieces of the puzzle, namely connection, support, and self-mastery. p.182

Really we have two sexual ethics, dramatization and normalization.
1. What about sexuality is of concern?
2. What kind of regulation should be exercised over that arena and what reasoning is used to persuade people to conform to it?
3. What ethical and emotional work must individuals perform to bring themselves into compliance with the ethical rules about sexuality?
4. What is the ideal mode of being that is to result form performing such ethical work on sexuality?

The different views have different aspectsof sexuality under concern. Americans are worried about impulsive hormons, and Dutch are worried about keeping connections.

Americans prohibit things and expel epole from the home, the Dutch consult their children and incoroporate them into the home.

>The two modes of regulation aim at different parts of the self. The dual
strategy of prohibition and granting a separated space outside the home to
date is more external in nature. Control is exercised by limiting, though not
entirely eliminating, the times and the external spaces in which young people
can explore their romantic and sexual desires. This dual strategy of prohibiting
and granting privileges aims to control sexual behavior but not the
sexual experiences themselves or the relationships in which they take place.
By contrast, the dual strategy of incorporation and consultation aims at
the inner life of teenagers, that is, at their emotional attachments and their
competencies within those attachments. By foregoing the power of prohibition
and granting leeway, while encouraging conversation and consultation
to reach agreement, Dutch parents aim to shape their teenage children’s
desires to behave in accordance with the socially acceptable rules p. 184

>Table 8.1 Dramatization and normalization as sexual ethics
American dramatization Dutch normalization
What is problematic? Hormone-driven self New attachments
How and why is it
regulated?
Prohibition and expulsion due
to non-adult status
Negotiation and incorporation
due to family member status
What self-work regulates
the problem?
Separation and hiding Self-regulation and speaking
What ideal state and
individual result?
“Total freedom” and
self-suffi cient individual
Gezelligheid and self-regulated
individual

And really this notion can be seen in different forms of the State.
>In short, the controlling and supporting dimensions of the Dutch welfare
state have gone hand in hand: 26 as is true of governance in the Dutch
middle-class family, the disciplining, incorporating, and subduing effects
of Dutch state policies depend, in part, on the social supports they provide
and the opportunities for self-realization they offer. Thus, just as a Foucauldian
analysis of normalization in the Dutch middle-class family misses the
signifi cance of interpersonal connection in facilitating the exercise of “invisible”
power, so too is such an analysis of the effectiveness of the Dutch
welfare state amiss in overlooking the social bonds between people and
the self-determination it helps foster. p. 192

For America, there are winners and loses, and there is no accommodation.
>The fl ipside of a government that neither aims for consensus nor offers
economic protection, however, is that those citizens who—for reasons of
political conviction, ethnicity, or sexual orientation—fi nd themselves on
the losing side of the battle are free to “break away” from “mainstream”
society and form distinctive communitie p.193


### Constituting Individuals and Collectives.

1. The different states create economic and psychological conditions for the ideas of sexuality that we get.
>Indeed, without a welfare state that supports middle-class parents
as they raise their children and bolsters the economic power of young people
vis-à-vis their parents, it is possible that Dutch parents might not have
the equanimity they do to confront their children’s sexuality, and that teenage
children would not feel as empowered to negotiate their sexuality. p. 194

2. The different skills learned in adolescent sexuality create success in their different state.

3. The regulation of sexuality in the family and the regulation of public welfare are shaped by different ways of conceiving, constituting, and controlling individuals and collectives.

Here the cultural notions are driving the train.
>Indeed, I have argued, the core cultural ideal of gezelligheid, and its concomitant
assumptions and practices, provided the Dutch with cultural resources
with which to weather the aftermath of the 1960s and 1970s. It
may be that the cultural traditions on which the Dutch middle class drew
as it encountered the challenge against traditional authority relations and
sexual morality, offered both faith in, and skills for, the constitution of secular
and equalized collectivities. p.199
