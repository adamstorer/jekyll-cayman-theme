Access the reading on pages 66-126 of the Marx-Engels Reader.

The first section is Estranged Labor, which is reviewed in a different post.

## The Meaning of Human Requirements

The thread of this section is not super clear. There is a lot of points that Marx hits on, but following along is kind of difficult from my standpoint.


As individuals make more things, there are more alien powers which subject man to a lack of manhood. That is, he needs power, money, things, but not the things that make him human. This leads to
> General exploitation of communal human nature, just as every imperfection in man, is a bond with heaven - an avenue giving the priest access to his heart; every need is an opportunity to approach one's neighbour and ther guise of the utmost amiability and say to him: Dear friend, I give you what you need, but you know the conditio sine qua non; you  know the ink in which you have to sign yourself over to me; in providing for your pleasure, I fleece you. p. 94

And we do get refinement of needs and production, but the workers have only simple abstract needs, not even for light or a nice place to live, or for sewage. The irishman only eats potatoes!

Political economy argues this happens:
1. By calling all life human life (even really bad life) they reduce needs to only the barest.
2. Since the worker doesn't have any real needs, any luxury is unnecessary, reprehensible.
>Political economy, this science of wealth, is therefore simultaneously the science of denial, of want, of thrift, of saving - and it actually reaches the point where it spares man the need of either fresh air or physical exercise...Thus political economy - despite its worldy and wanton appearance - is a true moral science, the most moral of all sciences. 95

As you put saving above all else, you stop doing the things that make you human. You have an alienated life!

And after all of this, if you live your life based on the rules of political economy, you are an ethical zero, without any moral compass, searching for profit for profit's sake.

Marx provides 7 ways that politicl economy promotesunity between labor and capital:
1. Capital is accumulated labor
2. Capital is partily accumulated labor and partly used as a working instrument.
3. The worker is a Capital
4. Wages belong to costs of Capital
5. Labour is the reproduction of the workers life-capital
6. Labour is an aspect of the capitalists financial activity.
7. Their unity is postulated by political economy. as some state of paradise.

There is an equality that political economy sees, but it is kind of this equal that isn't really equal (I think)

Marx then talks a bit about communism, about how formal equality is actually the political starting point. COmmunism is the appropriation of the human essence. Marx argues that there needs to be action to abolish private property, to create communism, and not ideas (This is a supposed refutation of Hegel, though I'm not sure it actually is)

Marx argues that communist workmen develop a different type of need - a need for society - and workers will pursue this.


## The Power of Money in Bourgeois Society

Money is the mediator between man and everything he needs, it is universal, it is almost omnipotent.
Since money bonds everything together, it must therefor also be the universal agent of divorce. Money becomes the alienated ability of mankind (p.104) But when you have no money, you have no  need or ability or true want for things.
money becomes the overturning power that makes and unmakes everything.

My problem is, I don't think the existence of money predetermines how individuals will interact with one another. There's too much more (culture) to the ways that we interact with each other to really succumb to money as the pure bond of all humans ot one another.

Marx thinks if there is no money maybe we see ourselves as only people. But how do no power dynamics  ever show up?

## Critique of the Hegelian Dialectic and Philosophy as a Whole

Marx argues that Feuerbach is the only one who is seriously critical of Hegel's theological and uncritical view of the world.
<def>Feuerbach's Achievement 1: The proof that philosophy is nothing else but religion rendered into thought and thinking expounded,  which estranges the essence of man</def>
<def>Feuerbach's Achievement 2: The establishment of true materialism and real science, since the relationship of man to man is his basic principle</def>
<def>Feuerbach's Achievement 3: Opposing to the negation of the negation the self-supportive positive, positively grounded on itself (huh?) </def>

The hegelian dialectic according to Feuerbach shows - Moving from abstraction (which is religion and theology) to the sensuous, and then back to the abstraction, the restoration of religion.
Therefore the negation of the negation is only philosophy defying/proving itself.

But in this philosophical exercise Hegel finds the real history of man.

Next we have a discussion of Hegel's own system.

### Phenomonology
#### Self-Consciousness
Consciousness = Here one has a sense experieince, perceives, and sees that  the world can be moved.
Self-Consciousness- One understands the self in opposition to itself
Reason - Observation of nature and of self-soncsciouness leads to reasoning.

THere are more defintions here but I don't know if it's really helping, it kind of seems like notes for Marx rather than a true description of Hegel.

Absolute Knowledge - Hegel ends with some self-conscious self-comprehend abstract mind where one universally understands itself. Marx has a few issues, but I think they are too deeply rooted in the philosophy of the 1800's to really have any meaning (as far as I can tell) for sociology. Though I think Marx is arguing that Hegel is focusing more on mind and abstract ideas, leaving the actual honest situation out of it, and in this way it is separated from any truth or science.

For Hegel, self-consciousness means consciousness of man.

I think a lingering question I have here is, what exactly is Marx responding to in Hegel? I guess the answer is "A lot" and we see it on different levels. There is a methodological critique, a critique about some interpretations, and some vague critique of the final society? I am not really sure..
