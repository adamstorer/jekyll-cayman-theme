Conceptually, what is it that the Siena model can do.
* IN Add Health we know there's homophily on smoking (or homogeneity)
  * IT Could be peer influence, or friend selection.
  * Here's another one - maybe popularity leads to smoking, or smoking enhances popularity
  * Maybe ties are based on popularity, but also maybe SES stuff, and controlling for other kinds of processes by which selection occurs
We can use diffusion models to look at diffusion, and understand how network structures change over time.

These types of effects might also accumulate or change over time - look at health disparitie sand how things change over time.

The model tries to produce a network that has a similar network - we try tomodel the process that look at this


# General Form of the Model

# Behavior Objective Function
* Siena Models did not have a behavior function, and were looking only at network change - but it's not too hard to add behavior functions -
* IF ALL YOURE LOOKING AT IS BEHAVIOR CHANGE THEN YOU SHOULDNT USE A SIENA MODEL - It gets at the endogenous network changeg and CONTROLS FOR SELECTION
* But our dependent behaviors generally need to be ordinal
* A siena model is predicting whether or not people move closer to waht one is tied to.

# Estimation
* Three phases -
1. Iniialize Starting Values
2. Use siulations to refine parameter estimates - we run the model multiple times and adjust the parameter values
3. Add simulations to calculate standard errors based on estimates from phase
# Post Estimation
Did we find a model that recreates important statistics at time 2.
