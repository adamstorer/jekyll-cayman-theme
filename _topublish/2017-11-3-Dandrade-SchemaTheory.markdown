In Cognitive Anthropology, schemas do something like organize experience. Events happen that trigger different schemas by which we process something through perception and comprehension.

To cognitive anthropoligists this kind of a mental map, a blueprint, something like a "schematic"/outline scene. Here a word, "to write" is thought of as a scheme. In english writing means language but in japanese the word can mean a drawing.

<def>Schema for cognitive anthropologists: Organized framework of objects and relations which has yet to be filled in with concrete detail</def>

Again schemas can be embedded in more complex schemas/sub schemas.

Question - where do Sewell's resources fit in here?

In writing, the schema includes sub-schemas of pens, paper, english, authors, etc.

We identify cultural schemas for restaurants and doctors etc, the descriptive content of the cultural schema.

## Cultural Schemas

FOr instance, when we talk about the schema of the family you get all sorts of sub schemas like blood, marriage, conjugal love, erotic love, family etc.

For instance, when youtalk about friendship you get that it's about being yourself around people, but there are true friends where you can really be yourself, so there is some kind of real self in addition to a social or public self.

## Schemas as Processors

These are not just representations but ways that we process information.

Schemas have some kind of impolicit rules that only exist when talking about behavoir.

You can automatically make sense of schemas, and non-automatic you are perhaps trying to understand relations between scheams.

Bourdieu's habitus here is seen as compatible with schemas. Lookat Quinn and Strauss for more info on this.
