Reading Chapters 1,2 and 12.

>I wanted to study the art of governing, that is to say, the reasoned
way of governing best and, at the same time, reflection on the best
possible way of governing. That is to say, I have tried to grasp the level of
reflection in the practice of government and on the practice of government.
In a sense, I wanted to study government’s consciousness of itself, p.2



>Before giving this abstract description, I said that this fundamental
transformation in the relations between law and governmental practice,
this emergence of an internal limitation of governmental reason could be
located roughly around the middle of the eighteenth century. What permitted
its emergence? How did it come about? Obviously, we should
take into account an entire, comprehensive transformation (I will come
back to this, at least partially, afterwards), but today I would just like to
indicate the intellectual instrument, the form of calculation and rationality
that made possible the self-limitation of governmental reason as a
de facto, general self-regulation which is intrinsic to the operations of
government and can be the object of indefinite transactions p. 13

Basicallly economics changed the way that government thought about things. It was framed within the original reasoning of the state "raison d'etat" It took up the vantage point of mercantilism.

>Political economy reflects on governmental practices
themselves, and it does not question them to determine whether or not
they are legitimate in terms of right. It considers them in terms of their
effects rather than their origins, not by asking, for example, what authorizes
a sovereign to raise taxes, but by asking, quite simply: What will happen
if, at a given moment, we raise a tax on a particular category of persons
or a particular category of goods? p.15

>. In short, through political economy
there is the simultaneous entry into the art of government of, first,
the possibility of self-limitation, that is, of governmental action limiting
itself by reference to the nature of what it does and of that on which it is
brought to bear, [and second, the question of truth].* The possibility of
limitation and the question of truth are both introduced into
governmental reason through political economy p.17

>At one time these amounted to the question: Am I
governing in proper conformity to moral, natural, or divine laws? Then,
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with raison d’État, it was:
Am I governing with sufficient intensity, depth, and attention to detail
so as to bring the state to the point fixed by what it should be, to bring
it to its maximum strength? And now the problem will be: Am I governing
at the border between the too much and too little, between the
maximum and minimum fixed for me by the nature of things—I mean,
by the necessities intrinsic to the operations of government? The emergence
of this regime of truth as the principle of the self-limitation of
government is the object I would like to deal with this year. p. 18-19

>That is to say, what I would like to show is not how
an error—when I say that which does not exist becomes something, this
does not mean showing how it was possible for an error to be constructed—
or how an illusion could be born, but how a particular regime
of truth, and therefore not an error, makes something that does not
exist able to become something. It is not an illusion since it is precisely
a set of practices, real practices, which established it and thus imperiously
marks it out in reality p. 19

# Chapter Two
We now link government and frugality in a new way through economics..


# Chapter 12
>Civil society is like madness and sexuality, what I
call transactional realities (réalités de transaction). That is to say, those
transactional and transitional figures that we call civil society, madness,
and so on, which, although they have not always existed are nonetheless
real, are born precisely from the interplay of relations of power and
everything which constantly eludes them, at the interface, so to speak, of
governors and governed. Civil society, therefore, is an element of transactional
reality in the history of governmental technologies, a transactional
reality which seems to me to be absolutely correlative to the form
of governmental technology we call liberalism, that is to say, a technology
of government whose objective is its own self-limitation insofar as it
is pegged to the specificity of economic processes.
 p.297

 >Ferguson’s civil society
is actually the concrete, encompassing element within which the economic
men Smith tried to study operate. I would like to pick out three
or four essential characteristics of this civil society in Ferguson: first,
civil society understood as an historical-natural constant; second, civil
society as principle of spontaneous synthesis; third, civil society as permanent
matrix of political power; and fourth, civil society as the motor
element of history. p.298
