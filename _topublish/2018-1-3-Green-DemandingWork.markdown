We create jobs but do not think about the quality of work. The book is meant to: 1. Construct an account of the extent to which facets of work life are different. and 2. to understand the sources of change in job quality.

## Assessing Job Quality

There is a good history of job quality research here. Survey data turned to measuring some aspects of quality but missed out on others.

Some think pay is the only thing, some people think about other work-centered aspects, and some think about some type of personal satisfaction.
Economists rely on a hedonic wage function:
>hereby is constructed the “hedonic wage function” that predicts a correlation between wages and less favored work characteristics, among workers with similar skill. p.10

The idea is that in addition to supply demand and skill, there are some positive and some negative attributes to a job that individuals weight idiosyncratically. As a result we can look at job choice and make sense of how people think about their job, rather than having to define anything form above.

 But valuing human experience can remain confusing. We set up our own values from above based on moral approaches, or we take people's values at face value (ha)

>This book will focus on skill, effort, personal discretion, wages, and risk as key indicators of job quality. There are, of course, many other aspects of jobs, but here the choice of job-quality aspects to be examined is driven both by the interdisciplinary conceptual and theoretical approach just outlined and by the constraints of available representative survey evidence. An additional motivating factor is that each of these aspects of job quality has potential links with major institutional and politicoeconomic changes that have been features of the modern era, including ongoing economic growth of service industries at the expense of manufacturing, globalization, technological change, and the liberalization of markets. p.15

What are the aspects from above we deem important?
1. Skill - this is an intrinsic value to get to use your skill
2. Effort
3. Discretion of workers over their tasks
4. Pay
5. Security
6. Satisfaction/Affective Well being

## The Knowledge Economy

Workers are upposedly better off in the knowledge economy because they get to use skills and get paid. These are jobs that require a college education, which are all exploding. There's the argument that there is skill polarization, as the deskilled are left behind.

Also, there is a lot of evidence that work is intensifying over time, though this is really hard to make sense of. There are a bunch of regressions in this book looking at all of these different things and saying things that you would generally expect.


There is a big widening of the pay gap! The rising pay of skilled work increases the gap. There is also more autonomy, allowing for more well beingas a result. But the average skill required for a job has been slowly rising, at least in the requirement of certain credentials.

>Intensification of work effort could be seen as a symptom of employers gaining the upper hand at work. Remarkably, however, effort intensification is also rife in that majority of nations where wages and other work conditions have been improving.  p.174

>American workers’ job satisfaction was largely stable for as much as three decades; if anything, it drifted very slowly downward. This stagnation is hardly surprising given the failure of average wages to rise, increasing inequality and reports of work intensification. In two countries job satisfaction fell significantly: in Germany from the 1980s to the mid-1990s, and in Britain through most of the 1990s. In Britain’s case the decline in satisfaction is directly accounted for by the intensification of work effort and the decline in workers’ discretion. p.177

Workers, trade unions and the state can all deal with some of the adverse problems that have shown up with respect to job quality. States can do hours restrictions.

Demanding work is a high quality look into many aspects of job quality. I'm not sure it has a single overall argument, it is an introductory text that is either superior to or complementary to Kalleberg's Good Jobs/Bad Jobs.
