## From Capital To Marx's Philosophies
A bunch of philosophers read Capital a bunch of times, and tried to make sense of it with respect to Marx's early works.

>is Capital merely one ideological product among others, classical economics given a Hegelian form, the imposition of anthropological categories defined in the philo- sophical Early Works on the domain of economic reality; the 'realization' of the idealist aspirations of the Jewish Question and the 1844 Manuscripts ? Is Capital merely a continuation or even culmination of classical political economy, from which Marx inherited both object and concepts? And is Capital distinguished from classical economics not by its object, but only by its method, the dialectic he borrowed from Hegel? Or, on the contrary, does Capital constitute a real epistemological mutation of its object, theory and method? p.15

Marx reads others like Smith, situating himself between them, and we should do the same.

Marx alo reads others in a idffernet way. NOt just sights and oversights.

I don't really want to read about how Marx reads,

## Introduction
>intended to deal with the following question: what image did Marx have and give of the nature of his undertaking? With what concepts did he think his innovations, and hence the distinctions between himself and the Classical Economists? In what system of concepts did he account for the conditions which gave rise to the discoveries of Classical Economics on the one hand, and his own discoveries on the other? p.73

What do we see?
1. We do not really see waht the object of marxist philosophy should be. We must ritically read to determine what we look for in Capital.
2. What is the nature of the object whose theory we get from Capital? Economics or HIstory?

>But if he did formulate the concept of his object without ambiguity, Marx did not always define with the same precision the concept of its distinction, i.e., the concept of the specific difference between it and the object of Classical Economics. p

In some respect, perhaps it lies in the nature of his discovery, because it is in advance of the concepts available to him. Particularly with respect to historical materialism.

## The Epistemological Propositions of Capital
Althusser first examines text where we see Marx thinks that value and surplus value are the real discoveries here.
Then, Althusser shows that it is difficult to find in political economy what Marx is doing.
>And we can see, if only in relief, that there is an essential relationship between what Marx produced in the theory of history and what he produced in philosophy. We can see it in at least the following sign: the mere existence of an emptiness in the system of concepts of historical materialism is enough to establish in it immediately the fullness of a philosophical ideology, the empiricist ideology. We can only recognize this emptiness by emptying it of the obviousnesses of the ideological philosophy of p.145

We can find a few things from what Marx and Engels say>
1. Every revolution in its object necessarily leads to a revolution in ints terminology
2.  Every terminology is linked to a definite circle of ideas
3. Classical Political Economy is confined to its circle
4. In revolutionizing economic theory, there needs to be a new terminology.
5. surplus-value is a sensitive point here.
6. What we really have is different conceptions of the object of political economy and value at all.

Marx discovered surplus value, a notion that others had produced. IT is truly a theoretical revolution.
## Marxism is Not a Historicism

## Marx's Immense Theoretical Revolution
>Political Economy thought the economic phenomena as deriving from a planar space governed by a transitive mechanical causality, such that a determinate effect could be related to an object-cause, a different phenomenon; such that the necessity of its immanence could be grasped completely in the sequence of a given . p 182

What does Marx say?
1. The economic cannot just be given becuase the structure of the economy differs depending on the mode of production. There needs to be a new construction for each mode of production.
2. All parts of the economic situation are therefore not necessarily uniofrm.
3. Since economic phenonmena are deep and complex, a different ocncept is required to understand the determination of its structure.

We are left with this question:
>More generally, by means of what concept, or what set of concepts, is it possible to think the determination of the elements of a structure, and the structural relations between those elements, and all the effects of those relations, by the effectivity of that structure? And a fortiori, by means of what concept or what set of concepts is it possible to think the determination of a subordinate structure by a dominant structure? In other words, how is it possible to define the concept of a structural causality?

Surplus value is what gets us there.

What I dont' really get from this is why we can talk about Marx in such a way, like a philosopher whose genius must be understood sa such. In all the sciences, we simply move to thinking about the person.
