WE are not efficient enough!! There is so much waste in the world and the worst waste is human effort.
This paper is supposed to:
1. Point out the end of efficiency.
2. The remedy is in systematic management.
3. The best management is a true science resting upon defined ruleslaws and principles.

<def>What is the goal of Taylor's scientific management?: To show that we are inefficient, that  management improves efficiency, and to show that scientific management is the best management.</def>

## Fundamentals of Scientific Management
WE need to get to maximum prosperity for employer/employee. Yet for some reason people believe that the relationship for both is antagonistic.

How do you get propsperity? You must be efficient in your work. So fous on training and development so you can do the fastest, most efficient work which sells more which increases the prosperity of everyone.

Sometimes men unfortunately soldier, do not do as much work as they should. WE lose so much from this! How do we get rid of it? What causes it?

What causes soldiering?
1. People think if they work too hard their friends will lose their jobs.
2. Poor management makes it necessary for workmen to soldier.
3. Some rule-of-thumb methods make going slow necessary.

Sometimes employers dont' even understand how quickly their work could be done!

Number three is the big kicker here -
>This paper will show that the underlying philosophy of all of the old systems of management in common use
makes it imperative that each workman shall be left with the final responsibility for doing his job practically
as he thinks best, with comparatively little help and advice from the management. And it will also show that
because of this isolation of workmen, it is in most cases impossible for the men working under these systems
to do their work in accordance with the rules and laws of a science or art, even where one exists.


>The body of this paper will make it clear that, to work according to scientific laws, the management must take
over and perform much of the work which is now left to the men; almost every act of the workman should be
preceded by one or more preparatory acts of the management which enable him to do his work better and
quicker than he otherwise could. And each man should daily be taught by and receive the most friendly help
from those who are over him, instead of being, at the one extreme, driven or coerced by his bosses, and at the
other left to his own unaided devices. p.9

This is of course the OPPOSITE of the alienation argument. But the frame is somewhat different. Is alienation necessary for progress? Should workers see themselves as using instruments or as instruments in part of a larger system of production?

If companies can produce more, they will pay their workers more is the idea here, and of those who do scientific management, the workers do make more money.

## Chapter 2 - The Principles of Scientific Management

So what does scientific management look like? It is task management, where each job is timed! But to get people to do better things need to be timed.  And then you can pay people per piece or get a premium from rapid work. You have to be nice to your workers to get the to buy into what you're doing. The best type of current management focuses primarily on piece rates or incentives. So what does a science give us? New duties for the manager.
1. Develop a science for each element of a man's work to replace rule of thumb methods.
2. Scientifically select and train the workmen.
3. Cooperate with workers to make sure the work is being done in accordance with their principles.
4. Workers should be doing no managing.

>The fourth of these elements, "an almost equal division of the responsibility between the management and the
workmen," requires further explanation. The philosophy of the management of initiative and incentive makes
it necessary for each workman to bear almost the entire responsibility for the general plan as well as for each
detail of his work, and in many cases for his implements as well. In addition to this he must do all of the
actual physical labor. The development of a science, on the other hand, involves the establishment of many
rules, laws, and formulae which replace the judgment of the individual workman and which can be effectively
used only after having been systematically recorded, indexed, etc. The practical use of scientific data also
calls for a room in which to keep the books, records*, etc., and a desk for the planner to work at.

But workers should do no planning here, that is the scientific managers job.

The most prominent element is giving workmen some set of tasks, and each of which has detailed instructions and time about how it should be done.

But also don't overwork people.   But you can actually time and train people to work better than how they were working before.

Even types of movements by an individual can be altered.  Everything can! It is the job of the manager to figure out the exact right way to get the person to do something.

But scientific management is more than a capitalist technique to squeeze out every last ounce of work from a worker. It is a utopia:
>The general adoption of scientific management would readily in the future double the productivity of the
average man engaged in industrial work. Think of what this means to the whole country. Think of the
increase, both in the necessities and luxuries of life, which becomes available for the whole country, of the
possibility of shortening the hours of labor when this is desirable, and of the increased opportunities for
education, culture, and recreation which this implies. But while the whole world would profit by this increase
in production, the manufacturer and the workman will be far more interested in the especial local gain that
comes to them and to the people immediately around them. Scientific management will mean, for the
employers and the workmen who adopt it--and particularly for those who adopt it first--the elimination of
almost all causes for dispute and disagreement between them. What constitutes a fair day's work will be a
question for scientific investigation, instead of a subject to be bargained and haggled over. Soldiering will
cease because the object for soldiering will no longer exist
