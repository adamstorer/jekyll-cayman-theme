Abstract: "Using a field survey of 461 self-managing work team members in four countries, we examined - (1) whether employee resistance to such teams mediated the relationships between employee cultural values and job attitudes and (2) whether the value-resistance relationships were stronger in some countries than in others. Results show that resistance mediated the cultural value-job attitude relationships, sometimes fully and sometimes partially, depending on which type of resistance (to teams or to self-management) and which type of cultural value was being examined. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

Self managed work teams seem to increase job satisfaction and org commitment.

There is weird cross cultural levels of satisfaction and commitment that are a little difficult to make sense of.

So they pinpoint a few cultural values as especially important for satisfaction, commitment and overall outcomes. One of the most important ones is resistance.

In most studies, people aren't totally sure why satifaction and commitment relate to cultural values or to overall outcomes. The issue is complex. People here are not necessarily asking exactly what cultural values such as "individualism, masculinity, uncertainty" etc really are.

The idea they propose is something like this. One has cultural values which leads to employment attitudes which leads to outcomes. Between values and attitudes we have a mediator of resistance. Certain cultural values predict resistance, and resistance to job satisfaction OR resistance to organizational commitment  depending on the meaning of the value. For instance:

>Additionally, we (Kirkman & Shapiro, 1997) have previously theorized that individuals will likely resist self-management if they dislike step- ping outside the bounds of authority, working au- tonomously, and taking initiative. Such attitudes are likely to be held by those high on measured power distance, which is characterized by a belief in the importance of status and power differences; high on measured determinism, which is character- ized by an emphasis on outside forces as determin- ing one's success or failure; and low on measures of a doing orientation (the extent to which people have a strong work ethic and are goal oriented). p. 558


The real issue here for cultural sociologists and the toolkit model in general is that you really shouldn't be able to find these pathways of meaning from cultural values to anything else.
