Beginning Questions for Science as a Vocation:
1. What are the conditions of science as a vocation in the material sense of the term? or
What are the prospects of a graduate student who is resolved to dedicate himself passionately to science in university life?

The way that money factors into the grad student life changes the way that they are thought of. Americans are paid but then are overburdened with teaching work. Germans are unpaid but then allowed to do whatever (mostly). Inboth situations, people are promoted in academia even when they are kind of undeserving.

>The fact that hazard rather than ability plays so large a role is not
alone or even predominantly owing to the 'human, all too human'
factors, which naturally occur in the process of academic selection as in
any other selection. It would be unfair to hold the personal inferiority of
faculty members or educational ministries responsible for the fact that
so many mediocrities undoubtedly play an eminent role at the universities.
The predominance of mediocrity is rather due to the laws of human
co-operation, especially of the co-operation of several bodies, and, in this
case, co-operation of the faculties who recommend and of the ministries
of education. p.132

But academic fates are also random because being a scholar has two different things - you can be a great scholar and a bad teacher.

Soto be a true scholar you have to be able to stand others moving past you without becoming too bitter - in other words, is this a calling?

<def>external conditions to have the academic vocation/calling: being able to see other, worse, people move ahead of you without grief</def>

<def>internal conditions to have the academic vocation/calling: you have to be extremely devoted to a specialty, and you have to labor for good ideas (which may or may not come from very hard work,which oyu also have to do). "enthusiasm and work, above all both of them jointly, can entice the idea."p.136</def>

And remember, this idea may not ever occur at all. And remember, the work will probably be antiquated very quickly. But there is some service one is doing in essentially disenchanting the world.


Sicence as a vocation does not take you to true bing, true art, true nature, god,or happiness. Science gives us the facts with which others can decide how we should live.

The true teacher must not tell people how they should live or make any political supposition. In fact, if you try to include your political agenda, you  lose the objectivity necessary of building a full understanding the facts.INdeed,you must realize inconvenient facts.
