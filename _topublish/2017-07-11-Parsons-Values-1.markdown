The reading for this section is: â€¢	Parsons, Talcott and Edward A. Shils. 1951. "Values, Motives and Systems of Action." Pp. 47-275 in Toward a General Theory of Action, edited by Talcott Parsons and Edward A. Shils. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.

This section falls into four chapters -the first defines orientations to action. There are five scheme pattern variables of value orientation that we will see.
The second chapter focuses on how indiiduals fit within a personality scheme.
The third chapter shows how value patterns work within the larger context of culture.
The fourth chapter focuses on the social system.

What is the pattern variable scheme? It has five dichotomies, based on the notion that any action is based on a pattern of choices.

<def>Pattern Variable Dichotomy 1: Accepting an opportunity for gratification without regard for its consequences, or evaluating it with regard to its consequences on the other</def>
<def>Pattern Variable Dichotomy 2: Considering an act solely with respect to its personal significance, and considering it with respect to its significance for a collectivity or a moral code</def>
<def>Pattern Variable Dichotomy 3: Evaluating the object of an action in terms of its relations to a generalized frame of reverence of evaluating it in terms of its relations to the actor and his own specific relations to the object</def>
<def>Pattern Variable Dichotomy 4: Seeing a social object w.r.t  in reference to some action, or seeing it as a composite of ascribed qualities.</def>
<def>Pattern Variable Dichotomy 5: The action has some undefined set of rights that come up only contingently, or it has some specified set of rights on the other</def>

The idea is that any value system can be put into these dichotomies. It does not matter if they are part of some specific social structure, these dichotomies apply to a general theory of human action.

If this is a systematic theoretical work, it will have these three attributes.
1. Generality and complexity of the scheme
2. Is there "closure," are the ideas supported or contradicted in other parts
3. Does it systemize theory so that we can pursue science

If something is to be ystematized, it will have some level of "primitive-ness" to its conceptual schemes:
1. ad hoc classificatory Systems
2. categorical systems
3. theoretical systems
4. empirical-theoretical systems

This book is supposed to be about theory construction, and not as much about how the actual theory stacks up.
