What is institutionalism?

In sociology, institutions have been regarded as the basic building blocks of social and political life. But different disciplines see institutions in different ways, and here we are really only focused on organizational analysis.

Economics - Individuals attempt to maximize their behavior over stable and consistent preference orderings, but they do so in the face of cognitive limits. The transaction is the primary unit of analysis.
e
They seem to use institutions in really different ways, institutions, institutional arrangements, and it is unclear exactly what is meant by the word. But here I think we are talking about something like market places.

Positive Theory of Institutions -political decision making, the way political structures (institutions) shape political outcomes. WHat is this? People also talk about institutions in international relations.

>Regimes are institutions in that they build upon, homogenize, and reproduce standard expectations and, in doing so, stabilize the international order.  p.7

What are institutions?!?!

>Institutions do not merely reflect the preferences and power of the units constituting them; the institutions themselves shape those preferences and that power. p.7

So institutions constitute actors as well as constrain them. I think

But ideas about institutions vary:

Some poli sci people say - institutions are congealed tastest, frameworks of rules, procedures and arragnements, or prescriptions about which actions are required, prohibited or permitted.
In IR it is sets of implicit or explicit principles, norms, rules, and decision-making.

In Econ and org theory institutions are different:
>In the former approaches, institutions are the products of human design, the outcomes of purposive actions by instrumentally oriented individuals. But in the latter, while institutions are certainly the result of human activity, they are not necessarily the products of conscious design. p.8

FOr instance, sovereign statehood may have just shown up. Is this a different take on institutions or just a different argument about how they work?

In sociology, institutions are independent variables, full of cognitive and cultural explanations, and an interest in properties of supraindividaul udnits of analysis that cannot be broken down into an aggregate of motives.

Institutionalization is a phenomonological process -social relations become taken for granted
It is also a state of affairs which define what has meaning and what is possible.

Economists think of institution and convention as synonyms, sociologists see institutions as rulelike objects in social thought and action.

Do institutions reflect preferences or collective outcomes?

### New Institutionalism and SOciology

New institutionalism - action is structured based on shared systems of rules that both constrain actors as well as privilege some groups whose intersts are secured.

Here is a list!
![list]({{"/assets/institutionalism-image.png"}})

But it also diverges.
It identifies different sources of constraint.
It also thinks about irrationality in the structure of the self.
It also sees organizations as bounded in different groups.
Institutions also reduce variety, and people in organizations are unreflective, take things for granted, and go through things in routines.

There are not norms and values but taken0for-granted scripts, rules, and classsifications which are the basis of institutions.

Parsons fails to grasp this for the following reasons:
1. He focused on evaluation to the exclusion of cognitive or cathetic aspects of culture and action-orientation.
2.He implicitly treated action as occuring as if it were the product of a discursively reasoning agent.
3. He assumed much more stringent requirement for both intra and intersubjective consistency than we see.

Garfinkel moved beyond parsons by arguing about order in symbolic systems and the role of cognition.
1. Garfinkel shifted the image of cognition from rational to unconscious routine/practical reason.


### Elements of a Theory of Practical Action

"Groups defined by clawss, gender, educational attainment, or occupation vary in their moral density, in their control of cultural resources, and in the number and dispersion of their interactions. These features in turn shape group members' styles of discourse, orientationts toward deviance and punishment, and cosmopolitanism." These are ideas that come from Randall Collins, as, they argue, an extension of B+L.

So what are the benefits of new institutionsm?:
1. Reestablishes the centrality of cognition
2. Emphasizes the practical, semiautomatic, noncalculative nature of practical reason
3. Spurns the assumptions of intra- and intersubjective consistency that were prominent in Parons' thought. - By the way, what was the damning piece of evidence that ruined consistency for everyone?

What are the downsides so far?
1. Overreacting to Parsons, no theorization of the normative element of practical action.
2. Overlooked important insights of Parsons, that different institutional domains evoke different reactions/orientations.
3. Failed to come up with a construct as powerful as the role system.

What is practical evaluation: Why certain ideas, images, or symbols evoke strong affective responses, whereas others seem to operate at the cognitive level alone.

What does Habitus bring?
1. It provides an alternative account to role theory of the differentiation of cognitive understandings and behavioral norms along social-structural lines.
2. It moves beyond the Freudian imagery of internalization to posit a generative grammar of strategic behavior.
3. It is multidimensional - different classes and different accoutns of rational srategies of action are institutionalized.
4. It offerns an alternative solution to the Parsonian problem of the allocation of persons to social positions.

What is missing still? Change, power and efficiency.

One thing we might think about is institutional contradiction, when individuals move between different groups that are different. And how coupled are institutions with one another?

# Institutionalized Organizations: Formal Structure as Myth and Ceremony  

Meyer and Rowan -
The chapter argues that organizational myths structure action just as much as formal rationality does. I don't see a good point in delving too deep into this one. Myths about how organizations work show themselves in these situations.

Here is a picture of the argument

People must do special gymnastics to do tihngs effectively in the face of myth.


## The Iron Cage Revisited

>For WEber, bureaucratization resulted from three related causes: competition among capitalist firms in the marketplace;competition among states, increasing rulers' need to control their staff and citizenry; and bourgeois demands for equal protection under the law...WE argue that the causes of bureaucratzation and rationalization have changed.

Organizations are becoming more homogenous and bureaucratic, but changes in organizations are not necessarily driven by efficiency. DiMaggio and Powell argue that change occurs as the result of processes that make organizations more similar without necessarily making them more efficient. Homogenization emerges out of the structuration of fields.

Again, why does it have to be one or theo ther? What do people say it is?

Three types of becoming the same - that is - institutional isomorphic change:
1. Coercive - Stems from political influence and the problem of legitimacy - for instance EPA regulations forces all the company to do something
2. Mimetic - Standard responses to uncertainty - when you don't know what to do perhaps you copy peopole around you?
3. Normative - Professionalization


# Institutions, Institutional Effects, and Institutionalism - Jepperson
INsititution - organized, established procedure.

these are like the rules of the game.

Institution - social order or pattern that has attained a certain state or property
institutionalization - the process of such an attempt.

order - standardized interaction sequences.

There are different definitions of the same CONCEPT IN THE SAME BOOK!!! WTF!!

>If one holds a pattern to be institutionalized, one points to the presence of ongoing reproductive processes whereby departures from normal forms of action defined by the desgin tend to be counteracted through routines.

"In certain respects, Yale University is more institution to New Haven that to most other communitesd"

I don't know, I'm liking this less and less.


# Constructing an Organizational Field as a Professional Project: U.S. Art Museums, 1920-1940

Where do art museums come from?   Things have to be individual structured as an organizational field befor eyou look at the particular organizational form?

What are the takwaways?
1. Studies tend to focus on local diffusion - organizations or geographic areas as units of analysis. The diffusion of museums was shaped by the emergence of fieldwide structures at the national level, outside the boundaries of particular organizations. This professionaly constructed enviornment had many actors trying to change the museum's structure and mission.

2. Studies talk about organizational forms become more legitimate as they spread. We see the legitimation of the form empowered and authorized the museum reform movement, which deligitmated existing museums. There was a change.
3. General and apolitical processes whereby ideologies that are societal in reach shape the form of new organizations. WE are all drawing from a GENERAL CULTURAL SCHEMA? What?
