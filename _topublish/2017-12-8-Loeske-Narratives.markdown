title:  "Loeske - The Study of Identity as Cultural, Institutional, Organizational and Personal Narratives"

Abstract: "I argue that the study of narrative identity would benefit from more sustained and explicit attention to relationships among cultural, institutional, organizational, and personal narratives of identity. I review what is known about these different types of narrative identity and argue that these narratives are created for different purposes, do different types of work, and are evaluated by different criteria. After exploring the inherently reflexive relationships between and among these various narratives of identity, I conclude with demonstrating how examining these relationships would allow a more complete understanding of the mutual relevance of social problem construction and culture, of the work of social service organizations attempting to change clients' personal narratives, and the possibilities of social change. Exploring relationships between and among different types of narrative identity would yield a better understanding of how narratives work and the work narratives do."

Storytelling is one of the main ways in which we make sense o four own lives and others. At basically each level, narratives create identities.

At the macro level, we have some kind of cultural identity, but there are also more specific types of identity.

## Narrative Inquiry

Where would it fit? Narrative have psychological, social and cultural functions. Many social movements are determined to construct new narratives or to change moral evaluations of existing narratives at all levels of social life.

>The core of my argument is that understanding how narrative identity works and the
work narrative identities do require examining reflexive relationships among stories of
cultural, institutional, organizational, and personal identity.


### Cultural Narrative Identity

This is the biggest one, in which we produce categories of who we are. Formula stories produce new victims, aggressors, etc. WE tell stories with categories to people and that's how we transfer them.

It's unclear to me whether stories are some kind of MEDIUM, some method in which we communicate, or on the other hands

Some stories are more beleivable than others based on how they are told and who's telling them.

Formulas may have certain codes connected to them, .

>Symbolic codes surround cultural narratives of identities because they contain
images of the rights, responsibilities, and normative expectations of people in the world,
and of the expected affective responses to these people. Symbolic codes in the Western
world typically construct one identity in contrast to another (Coles 2002), often as
binary opposites (Alexander 1992; Lamont and Fournier 1992; Smith 1998) such as
deserving poor/undeserving poor (Loseke and Fawcett 1995), victim/agent (Picart
2003), victim/victimizer (Holstein and Miller 1990), good mother/bad mother (Barnett
2005), heterosexual/homosexual (Quinlivan 2002), citizen/enemy (Alexander 1992),
and so on p.666

We are delving even deeper into a confused phenomonology?

These are kind of large dichotomies that we see in society, big picture things like described above.

### Institutional Narrative Identity

These stories create different types of actors - like a greedy lawyer maybe? And narratives of this type enter into the policymaking process.

Narratives tell stories that create types of people who need to be addressed.
>In this way, policies concerning women, work, and welfare were justified by
constructing their value as supporting the symbolic codes of traditional family and
gender (Burnstein and Bricher 1997; Asen 2003). The symbolic code of “maternalism”
justified the 1935 legislation on welfare (Mazzeo et al. 2003); justifications for the
“Violence againstWomen’s Civil Rights Clause” were accomplished through constructing
a story of the “monolithic woman as a pure victim” (Picart 2003:97), and the
symbolic code of “family values” weaves through debates over appropriate policies for
teen pregnancy (Asen 2002) p.668

THey also create groups, those hwo are and are not policy targets, and tell stories about these groups.

### Organizational Narrative Identity

These are created by organizers and workers in organizations. You might have schools, centers, 2-step programs, prisons, rape crisis centers. These are organizations who create a troubled victim that they must serve.

>narratives of organizational identity do not
always—or perhaps even usually—stem from social policy. Some places rather begin
their work with the formula stories and cultural identities constructed by social activists.
Informing early shelters for battered women, for example, was the formula story of “wife
abuse” and the cultural identities of “battered woman” and “abusive man.” These stories
and identities were constructed by social activists attempting to convince a disbelieving
public that wife abuse was a problem and that the “battered woman” type of person
deserved sympathy and help p.670

### Personal Narrative Identity

>Nonetheless, it remains that social actors want a sense of coherent
identity and that most social actors do experience a more or less coherent sense of
personal identity over time (Holstein and Gubrium 2000). The question therefore is how
a sense of identity consistency can be constructed within a world that can be nonsupportive
of, or even antagonistic to, such coherence. p.672

The way is through narratives. They allow th creation of some coherence. They also may be what motivates our background thinking.

>In summary, socially circulating formula stories with their categorical identities can
be conceptualized as members’ resources for crafting narratives of personal identity. Yet
social actors are not mere “message receivers.” They better are understood as “self
appointed members of the story telling team [who take] the narrative baton and carry
that baton, aggressively forging their own communication route”(Cerulo 2000:43). This
requires the complex, situated process of sensemaking within the complexity and confusion
of practical experiences. Social members do craft their own stories of personal
identities, and they do use formula stories as a resource to do this. However, creating
stories of the self is difficult, often a struggle, and success is a real accomplishment p.675

## Reflexivity

Is there some directional influence on stories of one type and stories of another?

The top level cultural narratives may shape other narratives. Personal identity might also be quite primary to a person. Also, stories of individual people show up a lot.

>Organizational narratives of identity therefore can be continually challenged and modified
by the unique stories of individual clients.What requires examination is where, how,
and under what circumstances organizational narratives of identity continue to be
embraced by workers; where, how, and under what circumstances personal narratives
told by individual clients challenge and modify organizational narratives; and where,
how, and under what circumstances organizational narratives are—or are not—
embraced by clients. p.676

Everyone's creating "types" of people, types of narratives, at different levels. And soem epopel might make or remake themselves based on the narratives of other levels.

Also, social change might need to make use of some number of different narratives. Women as victim narratives to change policies about spousal abuse may fail if some aspect of the narrative is off putting to some others?

The narrative stuff makes me question more about phenomenology. The types that people draw upon in argumentation not to make sense of the self but to convince others. Are these really types of logic that can or can't be implanted and connect up with people in certain ways, or are these something truly different than logical/analytic categores. Moreover, we make sense of the world and others through stories. Is anythign other than a story a truly effectivew way to make sense of how people think of the world? Is everything else analytic concepts that we draw over stories? Probably not.
