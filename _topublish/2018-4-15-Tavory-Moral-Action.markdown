Abstract: "This article develops a research position that allows cultural sociologists to compare morality across sociohistorical cases. In order to do so, the article suggests focusing analytic attention on actions that fulfill the following criteria (a) actions that define the actor as a certain kind of socially recognized person, both within and across fields; (b) actions that actors experience—or that they expect others to perceive—as defining the actor both intersituationally and to a greater extent than other available definitions of self and (c) actions to which actors either have themselves, or expect others to have, a predictable emotional reaction. Such a position avoids both a realist moral sociology and descriptive‐relativism, and provides sociologists with criteria for comparing moral action in different cases while staying attuned to social and historical specificity."

How can we know waht moral action is if we just describe what othe rpeople say is moral?

We need to understand how morality operates in different fields.
>This article outlines a research position that would allow sociologists to compare
moral action across sociohistorical cases without committing to a strong substantive
definition of morality, and while staying attuned to the ways in which action is
understood in the specific locations and historical junctures the sociologist studies. p.273

What is the methodological standpoint?
We have to
1.focous on actions that define the actor as a certain kind of socially recognized person.
2. Particualrly, actions that actors experience as defining the actor
3. Een more specifically, actions that define the self intersituationally and saliently, to which actors have or expect others to have a predictable emotioanl reaction.

A sociology of morality tends to be stuck between a realist and skeptical situation - is there something objectively good. If we think so, then we are realists, if not then we are skeptics.

Usually we think of morality as what is defined in the field, without deciding whether it is true or not, thus making us relativists.

## A Formalist Research Posistion

Again we have hat moral action defines the actor as a type.

>how action constitutes subjects both in relation to social “others,” and
within their own social group. In other words, we must attend both to binary semiotics
of self-definition and to the internal field dynamics through which people define
themselves. p.278

Importantly, we have to think about self-definition and the field through which the identification comes. One can, for instance, start by understanding what memebers are not and from there come to a definition of the moral.

Selfhood is drawn from systems of differences. We have to think deeply about where the boundaries come from.

MOral action is self definitional action that actors experience as defining the actor.
Moral action is self-definitional.

Here we are tyring to bound what is "moral action" as a type of action with a particular meaning tied to it.

Part of this is that some actions or designations are domain specific. Some are not. Sex with children is something that cuts across domains, whereas other sexual ideas are not.

>To take one example, ethical consumerism, as some
have pointed out, is an interesting site for the contestation of moral action, struggling
over the definition of self within consumption. Although consumption is always a
self-definitional act, what the ethical consumerism movement attempts to do is make
it both intersituational and explicit in new ways. What kind of mineral water, what
eggs, and what meat one buys (see, e.g., Crane 2001; Weber, Heinze, and DeSoucey
2008) become explicit self-definitional questions. If consumers buy “fair trade coffee,”
“freedom eggs,” or “free-ranging beef” they are suddenly offered another horizon
for their actions, as it defines them as certain kind of people—both politically and
ecologically p. 281

The salience of an action of course differs in different communities.

Finally, moral actions are those that deifne the self instersituationally and salientlty, and it has to produce a predictable emotional reaction.

>According to such a position,
emotional reactions are the defining elements of the moral. The domain of the
sociology of morality is thus delimited to these acts of self-definition for which
actors experience a relatively foreseeable emotional reaction, as well as those that
they expect others to react emotionally to. Being judged “hot blooded” is, at least
today, simply not as emotionally laden as that of being “bloodthirsty.” p.282

>The position developed above circumscribes a class of actions that would provide
cultural sociologists interested in morality with a common ground for comparison. p.284


We can sometimes have stereotypes/reputations that cut across situations that do not necessarily seem too moral. Perhaps this leads us to a too broad outcome?

Also, do we distinguish between different habits in different cultures as different types of morality? Our definition does not allow for this.

Also, does inaction mean morality?

>On the one hand, stereotypes include self-definitions that either are not salient for
the definition of actors, or that do not evoke a predictable emotional reaction.
Reputations such as “stubborn,” or “smart,” evoke different emotional reactions in
different situations; that Italians are considered “hot blooded” may not be perceived
as a salient definition of self. On the other hand, moral evaluations of action are not
necessarily tied to the typification (Schutz 1967) of the group the actor belongs to. p.286
