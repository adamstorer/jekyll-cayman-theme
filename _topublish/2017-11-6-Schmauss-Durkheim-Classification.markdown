From Rethinking Durkheim and his Tradition.

Durkheim is thinking about categories in a very different way than others. That is, language and experience are structured by categories that are social in character, rather than for instance, Kant's notion that concepts are logcially presupposed by experieince.

>Durkheim hoped to show that a person’s ways of thinking and communicating
about such things as space, time, and causality owed a lot more
to his or her culture than had previously been thought, and that these
concepts played an important role in helping to hold society together, for
instance through making moral rules possible p.2


An important Durkheim quote for Schmaus:
>There are, at the root of our judgments, a certain number of essential notions
that dominate our entire intellectual life; they are those that philosophers, since
Aristotle, have called the categories of the understanding: notions of time, space,
genus, number, cause, substance, personality, etc. They correspond to the most
universal properties of things. They are like the solid framework that encloses
thought; it appears that it cannot free itself from them without destroying itself,
because it seems we cannot think of objects that are not in time or space, which are
not numerable, etc. Other notions are contingent and changeable; we conceive
that they may be lacking to a person, a society, an epoch; the former appear to
be nearly inseparable from the normal functioning of the mind. (1912a: 12–13;
cf. t. 1995: 8–9)

People alone can function without these categories (space, time,  causality, class) are necessary for social functioning to be carried out in all culture.

There is also some confusion about exactly what a category is:
> In one sense, a category is simply a classificatory concept,
like plant or animal. In the philosophical sense of category that goes
back to Aristotle, however, a category is only the highest classification into
which a thing may fall. Hence, for Aristotle, “plant” and “animal” are not
categories since both belong to the category of “substance.” Space and
time, however, are categories since they are not kinds of substances, or
kinds of anything else, for that matter p.6

This book essentially puts Durkheim's arguments about categories within the context of sociology and philosophy.

Many argue against Durkehim's ideas of categories:
>the entire
Durkheimian program of seeking social causes for the categories is ill
conceived, question-begging, or circular. That is, they contend, Kant’s
categories could not have social or any other sort of causes in the realm of
experience, since the categories are logically necessary for experience in
the first place. Without presupposing the categories, one could not have
the experiences needed to acquire the categories from one’s culture. The
categories are not part of some sort of culturally variable framework or
conceptual scheme through which we experience the world. Nor should
they be thought of as belonging to some sort of psychological mechanism
for processing sensations into conscious experience. Kant’s logically necessary
conditions should not be confused with the psychologically necessary
conditions for experience. When Kant said, for example, that the
category of quantity is necessary for experience, he meant only that one
could not experience objects without their having some quantity or other,
since the very concept of an object logically presupposes that of quantity.
Furthermore, to assign social causes to the categories would be to make
them contingent upon these causes and thus to deprive them of the
very necessity and universality that Durkheim sought to explain, unless
of course he were prepared to argue that these social causes themselves
existed necessarily. p.17

Schmaus calls this the circularity objection. But Durkheim raised the same objection against Spencer. It's weird because his idea of what a category is strange, and by calling something a category it is unclear what it means.
