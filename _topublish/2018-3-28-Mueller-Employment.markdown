Abstract: "There has been a recent upsurge of interest among sociologists in the organizational commitment of employees, with loyalty and intent to stay identified as distinct forms that this commitment can take. This article argues that progress in understanding organizational commitment will not be made until conceptual and empirical distinctions among various forms of employee commitment are recognized and demonstrated. With this as the objective, it was hypothesized that loyalty and intent to stay are conceptually and empirically distinct from each other as well as from two other forms of employee commitment: work commitment and career commitment. This was tested with confirmatory factor analysis and was supported across a variety of tests. Construct validation was obtained by supporting the hypothesis that the two forms of organizational commitment but not work or career commitment are less stable during the initial employment period but then stabilize with tenure. Finally, predictive validity was established for intent to stay by demonstrating that it predicted quit behavior, or turnover, but loyalty, work commitment, and career commitment did not. Implications for studying organizational commitment within the context of substantive sociological issues are discussed."

What is employment commitment?

We have two right, employee commitment and work commitment. There are really two types

### Organizational Commitment
(loyalty) Kalleberg style - the emotional attachment an individual has to an organization

(intent to stay) Second Style - An Intent to stay

### Career Commitment
Involvement in one occupation.  Professional/Occupational Commitment.
Career commitment - Devotion to one's career rather than to the organization in which one is employed

### Work Commitment
Here we have a strong sense of duty to the work, intrinsic value on work as a central life interest.

He looks at these four different things over time.

BY looking at tenure, we see that work and career commitment is unaffected by organization tenure, but loyalty and intent to say will even out with tenure. These were then combined with turnover.

The question with all types of commitment is - where does this come from? Why?
