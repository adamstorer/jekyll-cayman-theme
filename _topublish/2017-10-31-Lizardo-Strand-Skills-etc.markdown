Abstract: "In this paper we attempt to characterize the key differences and points of convergence between two contemporary approaches to the relationship between culture and cognition in sociology which we label the toolkit and strong practice theory perspectives. We follow recent work at the intersection of culture and cognition in attempting to explicitly formulate the cognitive underpinnings of these two approaches in terms of the assumptions that they make about cultural acquisition, transmission and externalization. Our analysis suggests that in spite of very important differences in emphasis and explanatory range, toolkit and strong practice-theoretical approaches are complementary, although the specific types of modal situation for which each of them is best suited need to be more clearly specified. We develop a framework that shows how the two approaches can be deployed in conjunction as well as specifying the modal settings and situations that each will be more likely to handle best as well as those in which they will run into trouble."

This paper looks at practice theory as cognitive theories. The two theories are toolkit theory and strong practice theory.

## Toolkit Theory
<def>What is toolkit theory?: Individuals do not possess coherent, complex elbaorate structural codes, ideologies or value systems. One instead internalizes a set of heuristics, hunches and shallow practical skills that allow persons to best interface externalized structures, contexts and institutions</def>

How is this a theory of cognition? It is essentially scaffolded cognition. People are scaffolding different actions based on their surroundings without a need for systematicity. Toolkit theory is non-representationalist (does not require social agent create an internal model) and is a weak socialization theory. It is also based on the idea that people are too stupid to have all of the values of things in their head - so there is not some kind of deeply internalized coherent representation of environments.

## Strong Practice Theory
<def>What is practice theory?: Practice theory attempts to rebuild an account of ‘‘socialization’’ that makes room for some lasting modification of the cognitive (and ultimately bodily) make-up of the social actor (Bourdieu, 1990:63, 2000), that is the assimilation of ‘‘public,’’ extra-personal culture is thought of as resulting in embodied, intrapersonal culture (Strauss and Quinn, 1997:9). Practice theory, however, rejects both the what and the proposed mechanisms as to how this modification is accomplished—inherited from the classical tradition—while it broadens the notion of cognition inherited from the neo-Kantians</def>

Again there are no representations, no deep mental models.
>Practice theory, in contrast, is anti-representationalist
only in rejecting classical notions of mental representation not in rejecting the
necessity of developing an individual-level, experience-linked account of (non-symbolic, nonpropositional) representation (Bloch, 1986; Toren, 1999). Practice theory proposes an
alternative model of individual mental representation or, more accurately, suggests that we
must distinguish between different representational systems at the actor level subject to
different constraints in terms of process and storage

Practice theory has a strong process of socialization in which individuals learn quite early mental calculations/shortcuts.
<def>What does socizalization imply for strong practice theory?: acquisition of irreducibly embodied schemes of action, stored in procedural memory and manifested as a form of skill </def>

>Practice theory rejects the usual account of the how of socialization by jettisoning the primary mechanisms of transmission of the classical theory: (a) passive learning (‘‘internalization’’) through direct instruction, (b) ‘‘introjection’’ of entire, culturally authoritative conceptual systems or (c) conscious, active ‘‘role-modeling’’ or imitation of influential socially proximate others (e.g. ‘‘peer groups’’). Instead, practice theory suggests that in the very sameway aswhat is transmitted is implicit and lives in ‘‘practical’’ and not ‘‘discursive’’ consciousness, the process of cultural transmission of practical culture is itself implicit and diffuse p.212

## Linkages between embodied social structures and externalized cultural scaffolding

>Both toolkit and strong practice theories agree that most
culture is implicit and exists at the levels of skills, habits, fast dispositions and implicit
classificatory schemes. However, empirical applications of the toolkit approach have primarily
dealt with agents own discursive accounts of how they manage to integrate divergent ‘‘bits’’ of
explicit culture into their everyday attempts to craft strategies of action. Strong practice theory on
the other hand, focuses on global patterns of behavioral coherence that are seen to be the result of
choices made in the practical state, of which any discursive justification or explanation would be
a very poor (predictive) source of information (Wilson and Nisbett, 1978; Vaisey, 2009; Vaisey
and Lizardo, forthcoming) Both theories agree however, in proposing that the extent to which we
may observe coherent lines of action is contingent on the existence of already objectified
institutional realms: ‘‘fields’’ or ‘‘objective structures’’ in Bourdieu’s (1990, 2000) sense;
‘‘codes, contexts and institutions’’ in Swidler’s (2003). p. 215

There is a lot of discussion about the variable stability  of the situation and the scaffolding that is summed up in the following diagram:

>We have substituted Swidler’s (1986, 2003) ‘‘settled’’ versus ‘‘unsettled’’ binary for our
current (and we believe analytically more precise) distinction between contexts in which actors
can rely on externalized, stable cultural scaffoldings, and thus exploit existing structure to guide
their behavior by engaging in cheap, cognitively optimal heuristics at the level of discursive
consciousness (Clark, 1997), and contexts in which this externalized scaffolding is absent or nonexistent
(e.g. periods of institutional change or transformation, Clemens and Cook, 1999), and in
which reliance on more ‘‘cognitively costly’’ (Whitehouse, 2004) reflexive cognition becomes
necessary.17 We have also differentiated between two kinds of ‘‘unsettled’’ contexts depending
on the timing and the reflexive recognition of the agent that the taken-for-granted cultural
scaffolding is still there or not. p.217

What is a stable cultural scaffolding? Basically moments when we know what's going to happen and can act without thinking too much.
