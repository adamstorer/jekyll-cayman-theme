## Domination by Economic Power and Authority

Structures of Domination are at the bottom of a lot (but not all) social action. Think of a language being promoted as official.
>Without exception every sphere of social action is profoundly
influenced by structures of dominancy. In a great number of cases the
emergence of rational association from amorphous social action has been
due to domination and the way in which it has been exercised. Even
where this is not the case, the structure of dominancy and its unfolding
is decisive in determining the form of social action and its orientation
toward a "goal." Indeed, domination has played the decisive role particularly
in the economicaIIy most important social structures of the past
and present, viz., the manor on the one hand, and the large-scale capitalistic
enterprise on the other. p.941

People who pursue domination do not look for solely economic power.

What is the relationship between forms of economic organization and domination?
<def>Domination (from the general idea of power): The possibility of imposing one's own will upon the behavior of other persons</def>
But this would render the term useless. We focus on two separate types of power:
<def>Two opposed types of domination: domination by a constellation of interests (by a monopoly), and domination by virtue of authority (power to command and duty to obey)</def>

We may see domination in the market when we look at a monopoly. For example, setting prices and forcing other people to take them. But a cartel (or some occupational group) can force some actions on you,and yet it is still really power of interests. THis is different from "authoritarian power of command."

<def>Authoritarian power of command: The will of the ruler is meant to influence the conduct of the ruled, and the ruled are obedient</def>

These power can co-occur, bureaucrats may force each other into doing things.

## Direct Democracy and Rule by Notables

Often times domination comes in the form of some kind of administration, in regular functions. Powers of command need to be in the hands of somebody in any type of administration. This power, in direct democracy, makes it seem like people are the servant of the rule.

<def>How does administration work in direct democracy?: the organization must limited in the number of members,  the positions of members are not different from each other, the administrative functions are relatively simple and stable, but there is some form of development and training necessary</def>

Democratic administration often turns to rule by notables, since workers with lots of administrative experience have too much work to do. People who become politicies are typically enjoying income with little labor, and have a mode of life with some kind of social prestiges.

## Organizational Structure and the Bases of Legitimate Authority

The rulers and the apparatus for rule are connected to each other. How do authorities justify the legitimacy of their domination? Some people say they dominate based on blood superiority, while others do not based ont heir original position. Self-justification of power is often required along three lines.

<def>legitimate authority comes from what: a system of counsciously made rational rules, personal authority/charisma, and traditional.</def>

Forms of domination respond to the types of legitimation:
<def>What type of domination does rationally regulated legitimacy result in?: Bureaucracy</def>
<def>What type of domination does traditional legitimacy result in?: Patriarchalism</def>
Charismatic forms are less clear...
