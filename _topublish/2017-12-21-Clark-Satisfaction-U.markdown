title:  "Clark et al - Is Job Satisfaction U-Shaped in Age?"

Abstract: "It is generally believed that job satisfaction increases linearly with age. However, there are persuasive arguments, and some empirical evidence, that the relationship is Ushaped, declining from a moderate level in the early years of employment and then increasing steadily up to retirement. This paper investigates that relationship, using survey responses from a large sample of British employees. For overall job satisfaction, satisfaction with pay, and satisfaction with the work itself, a strongly significant U-shape is observed. Ordered probit techniques, which take account of the ordinality of satisfaction data, are used to analyse the relationship between these forms of satisfaction and a large set of individual and job characteristics. Despite the inclusion of 80 control variables, significant coefficients persist for the age and age-squared variables (the latter representing the non-linear component). The paper thus provides strong evidence for a U-shaped relationship between age and job satisfaction. Furthermore, it is shown that a similar age pattern occurs for employees’ context-free mental health, suggesting that both job satisfaction and context-free mental health are affected by non-job factors of life-stage and personal circumstances. The importance of changes in expectations with increasing age is emphasized."

This paper zooms out and looks at job satisfaction over time without diving too deeply into what makes job satisfaction. They do provide a bunch of possible examples of why job satisfaction might change over time. The paper is all about exploring high job satisfaction later in life.

In terms of general satisfaction, old people are sometimes just happier.

We have two questions:
1. Is satsifaction U shaped?
2. Do mediators control for the age related information.  

Satisfaction is U shaped.

>Thus, once other relevant variables have been controlled, there is a strong and
significant U-shaped relationship between age and both extrinsic and intrinsic job satisfaction.
The age at which job satisfaction is at its minimum appears to be lower for
intrinsic satisfaction than for extrinsic satisfaction.

Is this just a question of mental health?
Mental health, we know, is actually u shaped. HOwever, even controlling for mental health we see a u shape with job satisfaction. That is, the U shaped mentla health statisfaction does not mirror the U shaped other attitudes.

They propose two (mad eup) processes:
1. Young employees like novelty, and the youth unemployment rate is high so they are happy relative to their peers. As other peers age and get jobs, they're less happy and the novlety wears off.
2. Older people have reduced aspirations so they are not so worried about alternative comparisons.
