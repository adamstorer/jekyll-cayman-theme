Joe's suggestion - Right after the introduction - put the context part

That way when you go through the more literature part


Mary also thinks you should ?


(How much does Sameer start at it in the abstract)


Joe - when you talk about imprinting earlier you can maybe move the hypotheses and new things you might expand on and test -

Each of these things could be a paragraph drawing on the literature and you could do your hypotheses earlier. Add the hypotheses earlier and make it more real.

FIGURES
1. Maybe describe figures 1 and figures 2 more
2. Maybe try and bring in the discussion of mean and standard deviations
3. Maybe you can bring in descriptive statistics on this stuff
4. What the distribution of projects is, how often they change -
5. When you were talking about the sampling, how much do you lose -
6. How many change requests per month - all in a table


More technical questions from Joe
1. Looking at the correlation between distance 1 in distance 2 (absolute value - it might be worth justifying this) - having smaller than average might be better than larger than average - maybe you should just do regular old distances or at least take a look at it -

2. What's driving some of the distribution? How much change is there?


You can test a few different versions of this
