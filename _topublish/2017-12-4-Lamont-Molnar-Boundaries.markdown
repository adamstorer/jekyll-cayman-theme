Abstract: "In recent years, the concept of boundaries has been at the center of influential research agendas in anthropology, history, political science, social psychology, and sociology. This article surveys some of these developments while describing the value added provided by the concept, particularly concerning the study of relational processes. It discusses literatures on (a) social and collective identity; (b) class, ethnic/racial, and gender/sex inequality; (c) professions, knowledge, and science; and (d) communities, national identities, and spatial boundaries. It points to similar processes at work across a range of institutions and social locations. It also suggests paths for further developments, focusing on the relationship between social and symbolic bound- aries, cultural mechanisms for the production of boundaries, difference and hybridity, and cultural membership and group classifications."

Boundaries are important everywhere, and borders are also a part of this. Boundaries also show up everywhere in Marx, Durkheim, etc. It also seems like Simmel is super important here.

In building boundaries "symbolic resources" are important in creating and maintaining boundaries. In Elementary Forms, this would be the different totems. There are also social boundaries, and both are real.
<def>Symbolic boundary: conceptual distinctions made by actors to categorize objects, people, practices, and even time and space. They are tools by which individuals and groups struggle over and come to agree upon definitions of reality</def>
<def>Social Boundary: objectified forms of social differences manifested equal access to and unequal distribution of resources (material and nonmaterial) and social opportunities. They are also revealed in stable behavioral patterns association, as manifested in connubiality and commensality. Only when boundaries are widely agreed upon can they take on a constraining character and pattern social interaction in important ways.</def>

Symbolic boundaries are ideas, social boundaries deal with resources. This conception is strange, but harkens back a little bit to the schema/resource divide in Sewell.

## Social and Collective Identity  

This is the us vs them divide. Ingroup/outgroup stuff. WE seepeople adapt to their environment through stereotyppng an us and a them, and these stereotypes constitute symbolic boundaries. This is a social categorization, and is a more or less universal process.

## Class, Ethnic/Racial and Gender/Sexual Inequality

Stemming out of stuff like this, we see how social boundaries develop. Class boundaries have a cultural side as well as a social side. They work together.

For instance, lower class children fare worse because there are symbolic boundaries between class that are difficult to overcome. Bourdieu's cultural capital is an example of a symbolic boundary.

>class privileges: Dominant groups succeed in legitimizing their own culture and ways as superior to those classes, through oppositions such as distinguished/vulgar, aesthetic/practical, pure/impure (p. 245). They thereby exercise "symbolic violence," i.e., specific meaning as legitimate while concealing the power relations that are sis of its force (Bourdieu & Passeron 1972, transl. 1977, p. 4). They use their mate culture to mark cultural distance and proximity, to monopolize privileges, to exclude and recruit new occupants to high status positions (p. 31)-translating symbolic distinction into closure. Hence, through the incorporation of cultural dispositions, cultural practices have inescapable and unconscious ficatory effects that shape social positions by defining (social) class boundaries. p.172

But this is based on a conception of culture that exists at the national level. Boundaries make strange moves and people might see, for instance, the liking of many different things, instead of the exclusion of all but one type of thing, as a high class activity. There are also boundary patrolling practices which keeppeople in line.

## Professions, Science and Knowledge

WE can see how professions came to be distinguished from one another. Professions theorists argued that strategic professionalization is sued to define and institutionalize boundaries of the prefession against outsiders. Credentialing is also a way to produce social boundaries, and credentials are not strongly tied to anything else.

THis type of stuff also happens in academia.

## Communities, National Identities, and Spatial Boundaries

>Similarly, recent literatures on national identity and state building have looked at boundaries and borders to show that place, nation, and culture are not necessarily isomorphic. They also pinpoint the extent to which national identity, like nation is defined relationally and emerges from dynamic processes of interaction negotiation between local and national

Some people use borders, random lines drawn to show how these lines produce difference inothers.

## Conclusions
1. Symbolic boundaries are often used to enforce, maintain, normalize, or rationalize social boundaries.
2. Symbolic boundaries are employed to contest and reframe the meaning of social boundaries.
3. There are difference in how symbolic boundaries are linked to social boundaries. There are other factors at work.
4. IN some cases, symbolic boundaries may become so salient that they take the place of social boundaries. East and WEst germans still exist even though there is no real boundary.


>We advocate a more elaborate phenomoneology of group classification, i.e. of how individuals think of themselves as equivalent, similar to, or compatible with others, and how they perform their differences and similarities.
