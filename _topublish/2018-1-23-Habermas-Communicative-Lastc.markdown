# Concluding Reflections

## From Parsons via Weber to Marx

We have combination of lifeworld and system, and Parsons had trouble with combining the two. We can mayb epull from Weber instead. Weber knows all. In this we take up WEber's reflections on rationalization. Then we make sense of how it is critical of the Marxist position. Finally, we consider what social theory can do moving forward.

### A Backward Glance: Weber's Theory of Modernity

We see that Weber studies rationalization of the action system only from the aspect of purposive rationality. We need a more complex concept of rationality. This allows us to think about the cognitive instrumental aspect, as well as teh moral-practical and aesthetic-expresive.

We also see that Weber equates capitalist modernization with modernization more generally. Habermas wants to fix WEber's problems with the following assumptions:
1. The emergence of modern societies required teh instituitonal embodiment and motivational anchoring of postconventional moral and legal respresentations; but
2. Capitalist modernization follows a pattern such that cognitive instrumental rationality surges beyond the bounds of the economy and state into other, communicatively structured ares of life and achieves dominance there at the expense of moral-political and aesthetic-practical rationlity.
3. This produces disturbances in the symbolic reproduction of the lifeworld.

The question that I think is floating around the most for this section is - to what extent does economic structure reflect the logics in other points of our life? Are there competing logics?

Habermas wants a two-level concept of society that suggests the developmental perspective of a growing autonomy f systematically integrated action contexts over against the socially integrated lifeworld.

We end up with the proposition with respect to modernization that: a progressively ratioanlized lifeworld is both uncoupled from and made dependent upon increasingly complex, formally organized domains of action, like the economy and state administratoin.

In other words, capialist modernization  = system integration encroach upon spheres of action that can fulfill their functions only under conditions of social integration.

>In virtue of their efficiency, the organizational forms of the
capitalist economy and the modern state administration establish themselves
in other action systems to such an extent that modern societies fit
the picture of "a society of organizations;' even from the standpoint of
lay members. For sociologists, this new type of organization also provides
an illustration of the concept of a self-regulating social system. It is
no accident that the basic concepts of systems theory were first applied
in the sociology of organizations. p.306

The idea is that all organizations are more purposive-rational (as possible).

>Weber held that the tendencies toward bureaucratization in society as
a whole established two things at once: the highest form of societal rationality
and the most effective subsumption of acting subjects under the
objective force of an apparatus operating autonomously, above their
heads. Upon closer analysis, this thesis of a loss of freedom owes its plausibility
to an ambiguous use of the expression 'rationalization'.

With respect to bureaucracies,
>but when he
adopts the perspective of members and clients, and analyzes the objectification
of social relations in organizations as depersonalizing, he describes
the rationality of bureaucracies that have been cut loose from
vocational-ethical attitudes, from value-rational attitudes in general, and
have developed their own internal dynamics, in terms of the image of a
rationally operating machine: p. 305

The notion is that individuals become somewhat dehumanized within the bureaucracy and operate with the bureaucracy only in mind, and lose their general attitudes in the meantime. This may be true with organizations, who can disconnect from all sorts of things to create new relationships. For instance, modern law is uncoupled from ethical motives.

>In these spheres of action, legal
norms replace the prelegal substratum of traditional morals to which
previously, in their metainstitutional role, legal norms had reference. The
law no longer starts from previously existing structures of communication p. 309

This moment is the divide between an action orientation and a world of systems.

>The basic
characteristic of the action orientations of members is not purposiverationality,
but the fact that all their actions fall under the conditions of
organizational membership, that is to say, under the premises of a legally
regulated domain of action. W hen we understand business concerns as
self-regulating systems, it is the aspect of legal organization that comes
to the fore p. 310

But within the formal systems of action, the rational-purposive logic is at play with other humans in a mode of mutual understanding.

>Nevertheless, the
classical model of bureaucracy is right in one respect: action within organization
falls under the premises of formally regulated domains of action.
Because the latter are ethically neutralized by their legal form of
organization, communicative action forfeits its validity basis in the interior
o f organizations. p.310

This means that all action is held up within the premise of something else. So other forms of action are available, but they are disempowered.

But again, even here, while it is formally true that it is disempowering, the extent to which one can communicate freely with another is dictated by logics outside of the system.

>We can sum up by saying that tendencies toward bureaucratization are
represented from the internal perspective of organizations as a growing
independence from elements of the lifeworld that have been shoved out
into system environments. From the opposite perspective of the lifeworld,
the same process presents itself as one of increasing autonomization,
for areas of action converted over to communication media and
systemically integrated are withdrawn from the institutional orders of
the lifeworld. p. 311

>W hether the tendencies toward bureaucratization described by Weber
will ever reach the Orwellian state in which all integrative operations
have been converted from the-in my view, still fundamental-sociative
mechanism of reaching understanding in language over to systemic
mechanisms, and whether such a state is at all possible without a transformation
of anthropologically deep-seated structures-these are open
questions. I see the methodological weakness of an absolutized systems
functionalism precisely in the fact that it formulates its basic concepts as
if that process, whose beginnings Weber perceived, had already been
concluded-as if a total bureaucratization had dehumanized society as
a whole p.312

We take from this that there is a push and pull between the logic of systems and other logics within communicative action. One may win out over the other, but we shouldn't take it as a given.

#### Reformulated Bureaucracy and Reformulated Rationalization

Weber first focused on the mental characteristic of purposive-rational economic action. Whereas Marx stats from system integration (the capitalist system) Weber starts from social integration ( orientations). WEber's theory of ratioanlziation is as follows:
1. Learning capacities in marginal groups make their way into society via a learning process. There is cognitive potential that an be used for social purposes.
2. Societies learn through resolving system problems that present evolutionary changes. As societies learn, there is institutional emobidement developed at the cultural level.
3. A new form of social integration maes it possible  to implement technical organizational knowledge.

>According to this theor y, evolutionary advances are marked by institutions
that make it possible to solve whatever system problems are producing
a crisis, and to do so in virtue of features that derive from their
embodiment of rationality structures. This institutional embodiment of
rationality structures that were already developed within the culture of
the old society means a new level of learning. 'Institutionalization' does
not refer here to making cultural patterns obligatory, that is, to making
cenain substantive orientations binding, but rather to opening new
structural possibilities for rationalizing action. p. 314

This system to me has nothing to do with a particular form of "rationalizing" but can move to any form.

>W ith regard to the institutional
complexes characteristic of the modern level of development,
we must be able to show (i) that they are functional for resolving previously
unresolved system problems and (ii) that they embody higherlevel
structures of moral consciousness. The causal explanation then
consists (iii) in demonstrating the existence of a corresponding cognitive
potential within rationalized worldviews, (iv) specifying the conditions
under which the institutional embodiment of structures of consciousness
already developed at the cultural level can first be tried out
and then stabilized, and finally ( v) identifying the phases of the learning
process itself with reference to historical processes. In short, causal explanation
requires in this case that we combine functionalist and structuralist
explanations.

This is Habermas's reconstruction of Weber's protestat ethic.
>the bourgeois private legal order since the late eighteenth
century that made the economic system independent from the externally
generated, special, and improbable motives of particular groups.
Once the capitalist economy was established as a media-steered subsystem,
it no longer required an ethical-that is, value-rational-anchoring
of rational action orientations. This expressed itself in the growing autonomy
of enterprises and organizations vis-a-vis the motives of their
members.

#### Societal Rationalization and Bureaucratization

>Viewed historically, the monetarization and bureaucratization of labor
power and government performance is by no means a painless process;
its price is the destruction of traditional forms of life. The path to capitalist
modernization is strewn with resistance to the uprooting of the
plebian rural population and the urban proletariat, with revolts against
the establishment of the absolutist state; against taxes, price decrees, and
trade regulations

But is this really the case? Is a traditioanl form of life possible in capitalism?

In the end we get a loss of freedom and a loss of meaning

>To the extent that methodical-rational conduct of life gets uprooted,
purposive-rational action orientations become self-sufficient; technically
intelligent adaptation to the objectified milieu of large organizations is
combined with a utilitarian calculation of the actor's own interests. The
life conduct of specialists is dominated by cognitive-instrumental attitudes
toward themselves and others. Ethical obligations to one's calling
give way to instrumental attitudes toward an occupational role that offers
the opportunity for income and advancement, but no longer for ascertaining
one's personal salvation or for fulfilling oneself in a secular sense. p. 323

So to explain lack of meaning, we can use WEber's previous theses to say:
>Both these difficulties disappear if we connect the phenomena he described
critically with our revised version of the bureaucratization thesis,
and attribute them to a colonization of the lifeworld by system imperatives
that drive moral-practical elements out of private and politicalpublic
spheres of life. It is not the irreconcilability of cultural value
spheres-or the clash of life-orders rationalized in their light-that is
the cause of one-sided life-styles and unsatisfied legitimation needs; their
cause is the monetarization and bureaucratization of everyday practices
both in the private and public spheres. p. 325

For Habermas then, the loss of meaning comes from the integration of some spehere of life into capitalism, into bureaucracy. IN these moments other meanings fall away.

## Marx and the Thesis of Internal Colonization

>The concept of instrumental reason suggests that the rationality of
knowing and acting subjects is systemically expanded into a purposive
rationality of a higher order. Thus the rationality of self-regulating systems,
whose imperatives override the consciousness of the members
integrated into them, appears in the shape of a totalized purposive rationality. p. 333

The next section deals with th efollwoing (good summary)
>I will deal now
with the other two by (A) examining what Marx' s theory of value can
contribute to a theor y or reification translated into system-lifeworld concepts,
and then pointing out its weaknesses, in order (B) to see how we
might explain the pacification of class conflict in welfare-state mass democracies
and how we could combine the Marxian view of ideology
with Weber's reflections on cultural modernity. Finally, I will ( C) develop
the thesis of internal colonization and support it with some examples
from current tendencies toward juridification. p.334

Marx's big insight is to show that labor power is a commodity but not a commodity.
>Marx explains this process of real abstraction by means of the objectification
of socially integrated contexts of action, which takes place
when interactions are no longer coordinated via norms and values, or
via processes of reaching understanding, but via the medium of exchange
value p.172

We really have two thoery languages that come out of marx - a language of classes and a language of value.

Marx is also convinced that in capital we just have a class relation. He ignores the higher level o f interconnection.

>Marx conceives of
capitalist society so strongly as a totality that he fails to recognize the
intrinsic evolutionary value that media-steered subsystems possess. He
does not see that the differentiation of the state apparatus and the economy
also represents a higher level of system differentiation, which simultaneously opens up new steering possibilities and forces a reorganization
of the old, feudal, class relationships. The significance of this level
of integration goes beyond the institutionalization of a new class relationship. p. 339

Marx confuses system and liefworld as "realm of necessity" and 'realm of freedom.'

>The socialist revolution
is to free the latter from the dictates of the former. It seems as if theoretical
critique has only to lift the spell cast by abstract labor ( subsumed
under the commodity form). The intersubjectivity of workers associated
in large industries is crippled under the self-movement of capital; theoretical
critique has only to free it of its stiffness for an avant-garde to
mobilize living-critically enlivened-labor against dead labor and to
lead it to the triumph of the lifeworld over the system of deworlded
labor power. p. 340

Weber thinks system persists.

>Marx's error
stems in the end from dialectically clamping together system and lifeworld
in a way that does not allow for a sufficiently sharp separation
between the level of system differentiation attained in the modem period
and the class-specific fomzs in which it has been institutionalized
Marx did not withstand the temptations of Hegelian totality-thinking; he
construed the unity of system and lifeworld dialectically as an "untrue
whole:· Otherwise he could not have failed to see that every modem
society, whatever its class structure, has to exhibit a high degree of structural
differentiation p. 340

In particular, alienation, or when alienation might be too much, is difficult to make out in Marx.

The most decisive weakness of the theory of value, though, is the overgeneralization of a specific case of the subsumption of life-world under the system. This is actually a pretty similar critique to what I think Sociology has come up with.

TThe model of purposive rationality as viewed as fundamental for social action as well. This critique is totally right in my opinion. Marx starts with an actor that is set to act in certain ways, and does not deal with it in a useful way.

There is still some primacy to the economy


### Why did Marx fail to predict the dynamics of late capitalism?
1. Government Interventionism - Since the government is not only influenced by capitalists, the ability for the government to intervene was not totally fleshed out by Marx.
2. Mass Democracy - The two things that operate are money and power -

>Between capitalism and democracy there is an indissoluble tension;
in them two opposed principles of societal integration compete for primacy.
If we look at the self-understanding expressed in the basic principles
of democratic constitutions, modern societies assert the primacy
of a lifeworld in relation to the subsystems separated out of its institutional
orders. The normative meaning of democracy can be rendered in
social-theoretical terms by the formula that the fulfillment of the functional
necessities of systemically integrated domains of action shall find
its limits in the integrity of the lifeworld, that is to say, in the requirements
of domains of action dependent on social integration. On the
other hand, the internal dynamics of the capitalist economic system can
be preserved only insofar as the accumulation process is uncoupled from
orientations to use v alue. The propelling mechanism of the economic
system has to be kept as free as possible from lifeworld restrictions as
well as from the demands for legitimation directed to the administrative
system. The internal systemic logic of capitalism can be rendered in
social-theoretical terms by the formula that the functional necessities of
systemically integrated domains of action shall be met, if need be, even
at the cost of technicizing the lifeworld. p. 345

We must make sense of the way in which mass democracy creates social welfare programs which work against the dynamic of capiatlism.

3. Welfare State - From all of this we get a welfare state, based on how different spheres of the lifeworld get redefined as system environments -

But still we lose our ability to make sense of things. Maybe it is not the false consciousness of older times, but it is a fragmented consciousness where we do not synthesize ideas from our complex world.

>Everyday consciousness sees itself thrown back on traditions whose claims to validity have already been suspended; where it does escape the spell of traditionalism, it is hopelessly splin­ tered. In place of "false consciousness" we today have a " agmented con­ sciousness" that blocks enlightenment by the mechanism of rei cation. It is only with this that the conditions  r a colonization of the lifeworld a  met. When stripped of their ideological veils, the imperatives of au­ tonomous subsystems make their way into the lifeworld  om the out­ side-like colonial masters coming into a tribal society-and  rce a process of assimilation upon it. The di sed perspectives of the local culture cannot be sufficiently coordinated to permit the play of the metropolis and the world market to be grasped from the periphery. p. 355

So, to understand late capitalism, we need
1. System
2. LIfeworld
3. Cultural Modernity (surpassing consciousness)

  And apparently, colonization of the lifeworld can only happen when:
>when traditional forms of life are so far dismantled that the structural
components of the lifeworld ( culture, society, and personality) have
been differentiated to a great extent;
· when exchange relations between the subsystems and the lifeworld
are regulated through differentiated roles (for employment at organized
work places, for the consumer demand of private households,
for the relation of clients to government bureaucracies, and for formal
participation in the legitimation process);
· when the real abstractions that make available the labor power of the
employed and make possible the mobilization of the vote of the electorate
are tolerated by those affected as a trade-off against social rewards
( in terms of time and money);
· where these compensations are financed according to the welfarestate
pattern from the gains of capitalist growth and are canalized
into those roles in which, withdrawn from the world of work and
the public sphere, privatized hopes for self-actualization and selfdetermination
are primarily located, namely, in the roles of consumer
and client.


One part of colonization relies on how many subsystems operate under the logic of the system.
>The more the welfare state goes beyond pacifying
the class conflict lodged in the sphere of production and spreads a net of
client relationships over private spheres of life, the stronger are the anticipated
pathological side effects of a juridification that entails both a
bureaucratization and a monetarization of core areas of the lifeworld.
The dilemmatic structure of this type of juridi.fication consists in the
fact that, while the welfare-state guarantees are intended to serve the
goal of social integration, they nevertheless promote the disintegration
of life-relations when these are separated, through legalized social intervention,
from the consensual mechanisms that coordinate action and are
transferred over to media such as power and money. p. 364

One way to know whether something is subsumed under a logic is if the classification of a norm can be legitimized in a positive sense or is amenable to substantive justification.

>We have characterized modern law through a combination of principles
of enactment and justification. This structure simultaneously
makes possible a positivistic prolongation of the paths of justificatory
reasoning and a moralizing intensification of the justification problematic,
which is thereby shifted into the foundations of the legal system. We
can now see how the uncoupling of system and lifeworld fits in with this
legal structure. Law used as a steering medium is relieved of the problem
of justification; it is connected with the body of law whose substance
requires legitimation only through formally correct procedure. By contrast,
legal institutions belong to the societal components of the life.
world. Like other norms of conduct not covered by the sanctioning authority
of the state, they can become moralized under appropriate
circumstances. p.365


>
So far we have proceeded on the assumption that law is used as a
medium only within formally organized domains of action, and that as a
steering medium it remains indifferent in relation to the lifeworld and to
the questions of substantive justification that arise within its horizons.
Welfare-state interventionism has since rendered this assumption invalid.
Public welfare policy has to use the law precisely as a medium to regulate
those exigencies that arise in communicatively structured areas of action.p.367

# The Tasks of a Critical Theory of Society

Is it necessary to replace the theory of value? No! We can use a systems definition to get around it.  

What happens in the lifeworld (complex everyday life) when communicative action (deliberation) is replaced by media steered interaction (money and power).

When the lifeworld is not replaced by the system, the system itself is reified when some other mechanism of action in the lifeworld becomes a part of the system.

>only when th e lifeworld cannot be
withdrawn from th e functions in question, wh en these functions cannot
be painlessly transferred to media-steered syst ems of action, as those of
material reprod uction sometimes can. In this way phenomena of reification
lose the dubious status of facts that can be inferred from economic
statements about value relations by means of semantic transformations
alone. "Real abstractions" now make up i nstead an object domain for
empirical inquiry. They become the obje ct of a res earch program that no
longer has need of value th eory or any similar translation tool. p.375

Historical methods do not allow for three things that this theory needs to be further fleshed out:
1. THe structural differentiation of the lifeworld, particularly of its societal components
2. Growing autonomy of action systems that are differentaited out via steering media, as well as teh internal diferention of these subsystems.
3. Differneation processes that simultaneously dedifferentiate socially integrated domains of action in the sense of colonizing the lifeworld.

There is something about real abstractions that many theories dont' get at

>By "real abstractions" Marx was referring not only to paradoxes experienced
by those involved as deformations of their lifeworld, but above
all to paradoxes that could be gotten at only through an analysis of reification
( or of rationalization). It is in this latter sense that we call "paradoxical"
those situations in which systemic relief mechanisms made possible
by the rationalization of the lifeworld turn around and overburden
the communicative infrastructure of the lifeworld. p.378

### What occupied Critical Theory?
1. Forms of integration
2. Socialization and Ego Development
3. Mass media and mass culture
4. Social psychology behind the cessation of protest
5. Theory of art
6. Critique of Positivism in science

>In this way I have attempted to free historical materialism from its
philosophical ballast. 19 Two abstractions are required for this: (i) abstracting
the development of cognitive structures from the historical dynamic
of events, and (ii) abstracting the evolution of society from the
historical concretion of forms of life. Both help in getting beyond the
confusion of basic categories to which the philosophy of histor y owes
its existence. p. 383

### Howcan these intentions be taken up without philosophy or history?
I am not sure about this one. But I think it comes from the "diagnosis of an uncoupling o system and lifeworld."


### Discuss one topic, positivism, at length.
>The theory of communicative action is meant to provide an alternative
to the philosophy of history on which earlier critical theory still
relied, but which is no longer tenable. It is intended as a framework
within which interdisciplinary research on the selective pattern of capitalist
modernization can be taken up once again. The illustrative observations
(a) through ( d) were meant to make this claim plausible. The
two additional themes ( e) and (f) are a reminder that the investigation
of what Marx called "real abstraction" has to do with the social-scientific
tasks of a theory of modernity, not the philosophical. Social theory need
no longer ascertain the normative contents of bourgeois culture, of art
and of philosophical thought, in an indirect way, that is, by way of a
critique of ideology. With the concept of a communicative reason ingrained
in the use of language oriented to reaching understanding, it
again expects from philosophy that it take on systematic tasks. The social
sciences can enter into a cooperative relation with a philosophy that has
taken up the task of working on a theory of rationality. p. 397


>1wo questions must be answered: ( i)
whether a reason that has objectively split up into its moments can still
preserve its unity, and (ii) how expert cultures can be mediated with everyday practice.

Philosophy may be the feeder for social sciences.

>Alfred Schutz, who so convincingly depicted
the lifeworld's mode of unquestioned familiarity; nevertheless
missed just this problem: whether a lifeworld, in its opaque take-forgrantedness,
eludes the phenomenologist's inquiring gaze or is opened
up to it does not depend on just choosing to adopt a theoretical attitude.
The totality of the background knowledge constitutive for the construction
of the lifeworld is no more at his disposition than at that of any social
scientist-unless an objective challenge arises, in the face of which the
lifeworld as a whole becomes problematic. Thus a theory that wants to
ascertain the general structures of the lifeworld cannot adopt a transcendental
approach; it can only hope to be equal to the ratio essendi of its
object when there are grounds for assuming that the objective context
of life in which the theoretician finds himself is opening up to him its
ratio cognoscendi. p. 401

Finally:
>The theory of modernity that I have here sketched in broad strokes
permits us to recognize the following: In modern societies there is such
an expansion of the scope of contingency for interaction loosed from
normative contexts that the inner logic of communicative action "becomes
practically true" in the deinstitutionalized forms of intercourse of
the familial private sphere as well as in a public sphere stamped by the
mass media. At the same time, the systemic imperatives of autonomous
subsystems penetrate into the lifeworld and, through monetarization and
bureaucratization, force an assimilation of communicative action to formally
organized domains of action-even in areas where the actioncoordinating
mechanism of reaching understanding is functionally necessary.
It may be that this provocative threat, this challenge that places
the symbolic structures of the lifeworld as a whole in question, can account
for why they have become accessible to us. p. 403
