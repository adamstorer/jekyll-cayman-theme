title:  "Menges et. al - When Job Performance is All Relative"

Abstract: "Supporting one’s family is a major reason why many people work, yet surprisingly little
research has examined the implications of family motivation. Drawing on theories of
prosocial motivation and action identification, we propose that family motivation increases
job performance by enhancing energy and reducing stress, and it is especially
important when intrinsic motivation is lacking. Survey and diary data collected across
multiple time points in a Mexican maquiladora generally support our model. Specifically,
we find that family motivation enhances job performance when intrinsic motivation
is low—in part by providing energy, but not by reducing stress. We conclude that
supporting a family provides a powerful source of motivation that can boost performance
in the workplace, offering meaningful implications for research on motivation
and the dynamics of work and family engagement."

What motivates workers if the work isn't interesting? Carton argued that bridging abstract goals to boring work creates interest. But what about external motivations?

People want autonomy but a lot of jobs simply don't give any.  Families help but can also hurt, as they can make people want to work more and can also divert attention.

>More specifically, as depicted in Figure 1, we suggest that family motivation becomes especially consequential when employees lack intrinsic motivation, mitigating the costs of low intrinsic motivation for job performance by serving as an alternative source of energy external to the work itself and reducing stress. p.2

They are calling this concern for their families prosocial behavior.

>Family motivation differs from traditional forms of
prosocialmotivation in that it focuses on beneficiaries
outside the workplace who are not affected directly by
employees’ task contributions, products, or services,
but rather by employment itself and its affordances.
Thus, whereas prosocial motivation directed toward
coworkers and customers depends on high task significance
(Grant, 2007), family motivation can be
strong even when the job does not have a meaningful
positive impact on others. p.3

It is kind of a weird double edged sword, because family motivation is supposed to make you want to work more, but at the same time people sometimes put off having a family in order to work more. But the desire to support ones family does make one work more.

So the argument is, family motivation is positively associated with job performance - but this is a particularly male way of looking at things, right? The idea is that family motivation can compensate for a lack of intrinsic motivation in order for people to work harder.

## Hypotheses
1. Family Motivation is positively associated with job performance
2. Family motivation is moderated by intrinsic motivation.
3. Intrinsic motivation modersates the relationship between family motivation and energy
4. Energy is positively related to job performance
5. The indirect efect of family motivation on job performance thorugh energy is moderated by intrinsic motivation.

There are more hypotheses that are essentially the opposite of energy for stress.

## Research

They have a pretty in depth method where you can actually see job performance and there is a diary of effectiveness. They find that they are right.

>Our research thus adds to a growing conversation
about the meaning of work. Even though family motivation
is unlikely to make tedious work itself more
interesting, it gives meaning to work such that employees
see work as a way of supporting and sustaining
thosewho aremost important to them(Rosso et al.,
2010).When people ask themselveswhy they do a job
that does not provide intrinsic motivation, those high
on familymotivation are likely to answer that they do
the job to provide for their family.
