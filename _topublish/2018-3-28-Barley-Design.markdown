Abstract: "This paper challenges the prevalent notion that American managerial discourse has moved progressively from coercive to rational and, ultimately, to normative rhetorics of control. Historical data suggest that since the 1870s American managerial discourse has been elaborated in waves that have alternated between normative and rational rhetorics. We sketch out the surges and contractions in the rhetorics of industrial betterment, scientific management, welfare capitalism/human relations, systems rationalism, and organizational culture/quality. Standard theories of ideological change are shown to be inadequate for explaining either the general pattern or the timing of the surges. We propose and find preliminary support for a theory that combines cultural constraints and material forces. Specifically, the tendency for innovative surges of managerial theorizing to alternate between rational and normative rhetorics of control appears to be rooted in cultural antinomies fundamental to all Western industrial societies: the opposition between mechanistic and organic solidarity and between communalism and individualism.

Abstract
>This paper challenges the prevalent notion that American managerial discourse has moved progressively from coercive to rational and, ultimately, to normative rhetorics of control. Historical data suggest that since the 1870s American managerial discourse has been elaborated in waves that have alternated between normative and rational rhetorics. We sketch out the surges and contractions in the rhetorics of industrial betterment, scientific management, welfare capitalism/human relations, systems rationalism, and organizational culture/quality. Standard theories of ideological change are shown to be inadequate for explaining either the general pattern or the timing of the surges. We propose and find preliminary support for a theory that combines cultural constraints and material forces. Specifically, the tendency for innovative surges of managerial theorizing to alternate between rational and normative rhetorics of control appears to be rooted in cultural antinomies fundamental to all Western industrial societies: the opposition between mechanistic and organic solidarity and between communalism and individualism. The timing of each new wave is shown to parallel broad cycles of economic expansion and contraction

There are phases apparently of different types of control - coercive, rational, and normative. However, really we see a mov between rational and normative that moves back and forth.

Moreover, we see that we do not necessarily move back and forth, but keep aspects of each different phase with its different lean.

They split management into five eras:
# Industrial Betterment
People thought that maybe some normative control coudl stem drunkenness and create a reliable workforce.
>At its core was a decidedly Protestant notion of duty. Because industrialists had achieved wealth and position through the work of others, they were morally bound to shoulder responsibility not only for the economy but for the individual and collective well-being of their employees p. 367


HOwever there was growing criticsm

>By the 1890s journalists, academics, and trade unionists had begun to attack industrial betterment on moral grounds. For instance, in 1885 Richard T. Ely, professor of economics at Johns Hopkins and founder of the American Economic Society, published an early critique of Pullman in Harpers New Monthly Magazine. Ely warned that Pullman was a "gilded cage" for the workingman, "a benevolent, well wishing feudalism which desires the happiness of the people but in such a way as shall please the authorities p. 368

# Scientific Management

HEre we know much about this and it's technical control tied to taylorism.

>Taylor explicitly forged scientific management as a two-edged sword to solidify the engineering movement while challenging the ideological underpinnings of industrial betterment. Taylor thought his perspective more reasonable than welfare capitalism: He not only cast his system as a "partial solution of the labor problem" (Taylor, 1895) but actively criticized betterment programs and their notion of charity p. 371

# Human Relations

A new outgrowth of departments (As discussed by Jacoby in Employing Bureaucracy)
>Thus, although managerial discourse took a normative turn during the 1920s, it did so hesitantly, through a rhetoric crafted out of a modified Taylorism. Yet, by legitimating a concern with human factors in the workplace, the industrial psychologists and personnel workers of the 1920s paved the way for the emergence of a new ideology of normative control: the group-oriented rhetoric of the human relations movement. p. 373

This was partially Mayo's thing, and wanted to understand fatigue. There he studied the Hawthorne plant.

>Warner advocated the observational studies of work groups for which the Hawthorne studies are famous. In making sense of these studies, Mayo subsequently blended ideas from clinical psychology, sociology, and anthropology into a novel explanation for shopfloor dynamics. Crucial to these dynamics, Mayo argued, was the amplification of individual psychopathologies by group processes and the role of the first-line supervisor, whose behavior presumably determined whether a group would advance or hinder a firm's objectives p 373

>In direct opposition to scientific management's rationalism and individualism, human relations theorists argued that workers were primarily social beings driven by a need for belonging and acceptance. Social interaction and group affiliation were deemed necessary for human fulfillment and, by implication, harmony in the workplace p. 375

# Systems Rationalism

This is really a mix of different theories with no titular spokesman - there was an antipathy twoard human relations.

>All systems rationalists regardless of discipline peddled programmatic techniques or universal principles that would enable managers to plan, forecast, and act more effectively. Accordingly, each camp drew moral, if not technical inspiration from scientific management. p. 379

It turned to electrical engineering and computer science to try and understand the inputs and outputs of good work. It was much more about how work was suppose to be set up than thinking specifically about workers.

# Organizational Culture and Quality

A renewed focus! Academics who argued for thinking about work as culture, and they got picked up by all sorts of stuff.

>flexibility. Although rationalization may have streamlined production, it was criticized for rewarding specialization, parochialism, and calculative involvement at the expense of loyalty and commitment. Culture's proponents claimed that rampant systematization posed few problems in a period of surplus and stability but that the costs of relying on systemic controls materialized when environments became turbulent. Critics argued that under such conditions exclusive reliance on rational controls might even exacerbate anomie to the point where further rationalization would actually occasion declines in productivity p.382

In addition, shared beleifs and values should produce good workers and good work, rather than autonomotons.

Perhaps managers work in a bipolar framework, alternating between what is and the opposite.
>framework. Perhaps also for cultural reasons, American theorists have broached the duality of mechanical and organic solidarity by emphasizing either one or the other. But because the two visions form a duality, any ideology that emphasizes normative action is vulnerable to charges of ignoring rational action, and vice versa. Hence, temporal segregation offers an inherently unstable resolution. p. 386

The shift seems to happen due to timing. Levels of labor activity (unionization) may fan a normative focus.

Perhapss at the edges of profitability we see shifts in action .

Waves of theorizing seem to match up with the espansion
