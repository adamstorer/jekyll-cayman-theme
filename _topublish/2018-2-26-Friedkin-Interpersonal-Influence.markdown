Abstract: "I examine the relationship between interpersonal power and influence during the resolution of an issue in an organization. Controlling for elementary bases of power (rewards, coercion, authority, identification, and expertise), I investigate three bases of power that arise from the structure of social networks (cohesion, similarity, and centrality). An analysis of longitudinal data on actors' bases of social power, frequency of interpersonal communications, and interpersonal influences indicates that cohesion, similarity, and centrality have significant effects on issue-related influence net of the elementary power bases. The effects of the structural bases are mediated by the frequency of issue-related communication. The primary structural determinant of the frequency of issue-related communication is network cohesion."

>I examine the relationship between interpersonal power and influence during the resolution of an issue in an organization. Controlling for elementary bases of power (rewards, coercion, authority, identification, and expertise), I investigate three bases of power that arise from the structure of social networks (cohesion, similarity, and centrality). An analysis of longitudinal data on actors' bases of social power, frequency of interpersonal communications, and interpersonal influences indicates that cohesion, similarity, and centrality have significant effects on issue-related influence net of the elementary power bases. The effects of the structural bases are mediated by the frequency of issue-related communication. The primary structural determinant of the frequency of issue-related communication is network cohesion.

To get one person to do something, you need to have resources that are valued by them. In addition, there are structural bases of power.

## Structural Perspectives on Power
WE have three structural features:
1. Cohesion - A strong cohevisve group (a dense network, short pathways between members)
2. Similarity - Similar roles (father, physician, gang leader, middle-manager, peripheral friends) (a second part of structural cohesion)
>The effects of structural similarity on inter- personal influence are contingent on interper- sonal visibility. Structural similarity can estab- lish salience, which encourages P to respond to O's opinion on an issue. However, not only must P be aware of O's opinion on the issue, P must also be aware of their structural similar- ity. Without information about O's social posi- tion, P may not attach particular salience to O's displayed opinions. p.4

3. Centrality - IF they are the center of the network.

They affect two components of social influence
1. Visibility - How visible the perspective is
2. Salience - How

To look at this, Friedkin studied teacher. Teachers were surveyd in two waves. (the same school) Then they made dyads.

They measured interpersonal influence by how much a certain faculty member influenced their thought on an issue. They also did interpersonal communication.

Then they looked at the five types of power:
1. Reward Power - IF they do something they will get a reward
2. Coercive power - They are forced to
3. Legitimate Power - They have a legitimate right to prescribe behavior
4. Referent Power - Based on their relationship
5. Expert Power - They have some special knowledge

And then two more
1. Structural Cohesion
2. Centrality

What we see is that interpersonal communication is the main factor, rather than any specific role-based aspect.
