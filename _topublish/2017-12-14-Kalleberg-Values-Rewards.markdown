Abstract: "This paper attempts to develop a theory of job satisfaction which incorporates differ- ences in work values and perceived job characteristics as key explanatory variables. It empirically examines the relationship between job satisfaction and the work values and job rewards associated with six dimensions of work-intrinsic, convenience, financial, relations with co-workers, career opportunities and resource adequacy. It is found that work values have independent-effects on job satisfaction. The extent to which workers are able to obtain perceived job rewards is conceptualized to be a function of their degree of control over their employment situations. The paper also seeks to develop a framework which links the variation in the job satisfactions of workers to the factors that influence the degree of their control over the attainment of job rewards in Ameri- can society. The analyses in this paper are based on data from the 1972-73 Quality of Employment Survey."

The analyses in this paper are based on data from the 1972-73 Quality of Employment Survey.

So Kalleberg is taking some large, perhaps Marxist, notion of job satisfaction or argument about how satisfaction works and breaking it down into its component parts.  

So why does job satisfaction vary?
1. Individual Personalites - How neurotic or generally unhappy is the person?
2. Types of Jobs - Different types of jobs have characteristics, some of which are better. Better characteristics mean happier people.
3. A combined approach - Objective properties of the job mix with inner states of the individual to create constellations of satisfaction.

This paper takes approach 3, from a quality of employment survey in 1972-3.

## Data

Job satisfaction - That is, some overall satisfaction separate from specific aspects of the work. One asks how satisfied they are with their job and whether they would recommend it to a friend etc.

Work Values - 34 Characteristics of work values were put into a matrix and then they factored out 6: An intrinsic dimension (is it interesting), A convenience dimension (is it easy to get to etc.), a financial dimension (pay!), relatiosnhip with coworkers, does the job effect the career, resource adequacy - do you have enough resources to get the job done.

Job Rewards - Some objective characteristics of what the job provides

## Results

On a first look it looks like values are not correlated with job satisfaction.

>by re- moving the positive association of values and job satisfaction produced by the posi- tive correlation of values and rewards, the negative net effect of values on job satis- faction is revealed

Job rewards suppress job satisfaction. But work values do have some sort of efect on job satisfacion, and the rewards of job

### Degree of Control and Job Rewards

Control is a big thing for marx and what's the relationship between Marx and job rewards?

>Workers who possess resources in the form of membership in a union or em- ployee's association perceive that they have greater rewards with respect to the financial dimension and lower rewards with respect to the intrinsic and resource adequacy di- mensions of work.

In other words, here are six dimensions of work, how do we see them operating in society?

And we also look at what each of the things have in relation to satisfaction:

>These results suggest that the direct effects of the degree of control measures on job satisfaction are substantially mediated by the reward variables.22 For example, while race, the unemployment rate and years in the labor force have significant effects on job satisfaction in column 1, only the latter has a significant direct effect on job satisfaction when values and rewards are controlled.

It seems though that the idea is:
1. Work values have independent and significant effects on job satisfaction.
2. What links the variation in job satisfaction to the factors that influence workers' attainment of job rewards?

>Variation in work values may be hy- pothesized to result from three major sets of social factors: (1) socialization and other types of life experiences which occur prior to the individual's entry into the labor force and which shape one's view of the importance of the various dimensions of work; (2) nonwork social roles which im- pose constraints and contingencies on the types of meanings that the individual can seek from the work activity; (3) work ex- periences which affect the mature worker's valuation of the potential rewards

Also, the distribution of types of job rewards varies among people. There is a type of stratification here.
