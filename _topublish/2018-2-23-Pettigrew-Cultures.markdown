Abstract: "This paper is representative of my long-term research inter- ests in the longitudinal-processual study of organizations, a perspective I feel is neglected. The longitudinal-processual approach to the study of organizations recognizes that an organization or any other social system may profitably be explored as a continuing system with a past, a present, and a future. Sound theory must, therefore, take into account the history and the future of a system and relate them to the present. What are advocated here are not mere meth- odological niceties. They have a fundamental impact on the kinds of research problems that become open for investiga- tion, the possibilities of making certain kinds of conceptual developments, and the choice of language systems with which these concepts are expressed. A longitudinal- processual analysis is more likely to be interested in lan- guage systems of becoming than of being, of processes of structural elaboration rather than the precise description of structural form, of mechanisms that create, maintain, and dissolve systems of power (Pettigrew, 1973) rather than just attempt to codify distributions of power at one point in time."

The study is loosely based off of a look into a British boarding school.

It focuses on social drama - and a sequence of them. By focusing on the dramas, we focus on the contexts of the people. What are the key concepts of organizational culture.

The idea is there is a kind of top down organizational culture in which purpose and commitment are generated through a founder (and the background of all other things)

It is really about trying to bring culture into a study of entrepreneurs.

>If we move away from considering (in isolation) the personal characteristics of entrepreneurs toward an analysis of the person in his context, the problem of entrepreneurship may be stated in a specifically interactive fashion. I assume here that the essential problem of entrepreneurship is the trans- lation of individual drive into collective purpose and commit- ment. With this viewpoint the focus is not what makes the entrepreneur but rather what does the entrepreneur make. p.5


This is partly done through symbolism and the creation of organizational cultures.

>Entrepreneurs may be seen not only as creators of some of the more rational and tangible aspects of organizations such as structures and technologies but also as creators of sym- bols, ideologies, languages, beliefs, rituals, and myths, as- pects of the more cultural and expressive components of organizational life p.6


>A potentially more fruitful approach is to regard culture as the source of a family of concepts. The offsprings of the concept of culture I have in mind are symbol, language, ideology, belief, ritual, and myth. p.6

The ultimate problem here is a deep one.

>Another aspect of organizational culture is the system of vocal signs we call language. With its immense variety and complexity, language can typify and stabilize experience and integrate those experiences into a meaningful whole (Berger and Luckman, 1966). These processes of typification are es- sential features of the process of creating culture in a new organization. p.7

Entrepreneurs build this stuff using ideology - a set of beliefs about the ocial world and how it operates - this automatically connects discourse and action.

Entrepreneurs, then, deal with problems of commitment - by utilizing organizational culture.


>Building commitment can involve action at the entry stage of the organization. The entrepreneur may initially be able to recruit on the basis of prior acquaintance and homogeneity of background. He may continue to recruit in a highly per- sonalized fashion, insisting on seeing all potential employees and using the interview process as an opportunity to display his vision, personal drive, and presence. Once inside the new organization the employer is confronted with the emerging culture through the language, the performance and observation of everyday tasks, the regular contact, and the group rituals. In the school the rituals varied from dra- matic public meetings, where organizational deviants were exposed, to the headmaster's breakfast. p.11
