# Capital Volume 1
## Part 8, Chapter 26
## The Secret of Primitive Accumulation

Access the reading [here](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm).

The previous chapters have shown a spiral of capital accumulation. We move from money to capital to surplus value to more capital, and the first set of money requires there to already be some pre-existence of masses of capital and labor power. This is the stage of primitive accumulation.
This creates a sort of myth that says hard working people make money and others spend even what they don't have. But this is a goofy thing to think. In starting points of capitalism, that is, the pre-capitalist accumulation of capital, we see more insidious forces at work.

>In actual history it is notorious that conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, briefly force, play the great part.

Once capitalist systems come into being, those who do not start with capital cannot make it through their labor alone.

>The so-called primitive accumulation, therefore, is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer from the means of production.

Once capitalism is in effect, this is already the case. In the feudal system, there were all sorts of rules about what a person could do made by guilds. While they are no longer serfs and can do different things, they also lose their protections in a capitalist society.

 <def>primitive accumulation: basically clear expropriation of land from the collective to the individual</def>

## Chapter 27
Fedual retainers were broken up at the end of the 16th century and a mass of people were thrown in the labor market.
When these feudal powers forced peasantry from the land, it made them into a large body of proletarians, and everyone was terrified of a revolution. There weren't really laws to allow this to work, and workers weren't allowed to make houses too close to the cities. There ended up being tons of peasants, way more than other.

There was eventually a "glorious revolution" which forced all workers into renters - state lands that had been managed "modestly" ended up being turned into very fancy houses etc. These communal places were privatized, and given to wealthy people. Some people got huge farms while others got nothing.

That is to say, capitalist accumulation begins with appropriation, and swift legal shifts from public to private, and the factors of privatization are always unfair. This is, I think, the enclosure movement. And it is somehow glorified by other economists etc.  This ends, finally, in forcibly moving people off land that had been expropriated from them.

<def>Primitive Accumulation2: The spoliation of the churchâ€™s property, the fraudulent alienation of the State domains, the robbery of the common lands, the usurpation of feudal and clan property, and its transformation into modern private property under circumstances of reckless terrorism, were just so many idyllic methods of primitive accumulation. </def>

## Chatper 28: Bloody Legislation Against the Expropriated, from the End of the 15th Century. Forcing Down of Wages by Acts of Parliament

Now in England there are way too many free proletarians - and they could not adapt themselves to some other form of activity.  They were all basically turned int o beggars
Beggars get licenses, but whippings and imprisonment for "vagabonds." Second arrest, vagabond has half an ear sliced off, and the third time they are executed.

Basically, Marx's argument here is that economic situations make the man, and the government basically makes a poor man and then treats them terribly. This is some pretty horrific stuff:

>A statute of the first year of his reign, 1547, ordains that if anyone refuses to work, he shall be condemned as a slave to the person who has denounced him as an idler. The master shall feed his slave on bread and water, weak broth and such refuse meat as he thinks fit. He has the right to force him to do any work, no matter how disgusting, with whip and chains. If the slave is absent a fortnight, he is condemned to slavery for life and is to be branded on forehead or back with the letter S; if he runs away thrice, he is to be executed as a felon.

>Thus were the agricultural people, first forcibly expropriated from the soil, driven from their homes, turned into vagabonds, and then whipped, branded, tortured by laws grotesquely terrible, into the discipline necessary for the wage system.

Earlier, in 1360, laws are made that set up "a tariff of wages" for piece-work and day-work. People used to hire themselves out by year. You could be imprisoned for paying more than you were supposed to. The money wages would rise, but not with inflation. If you broke a year long contract, you could be seen as a criminal.

Trade Unions during this time were essentially bans of owners exploiting people as much as possible. Trade Union laws forbidding strike or walkout were made laws. In 1791 any right of association was taken away.

## Chapter 29: Genesis of the Capitalist Farmer

From Marx's point of view, the last few chapters basically show the forcible creation of a class of outlawed proletarians.
But where did the real capitalists come from?
The farmer capitalists were bailifss, a type of serf? He is basically a peasant but exploits wage labor. Eventually he becomes a farmer and pays part of the surplus to the landlord as rent, sometime in the fifteenth century. WHen the common lands were taken, these capitalists had much more land to speedily enrich themselves. More people to work on the farms from getting pushed out and running out of mines meant lower prices for labor and more money for the worker.

## Chapter 30: Reaction of the Agricultural Revolution on Industry. Creation of the Home-Market for Industrial Capital

Eventually less and less people had to work on the farm. This let means of nourishment be part of a larger capitalist system. You could work off the farm for your food.

>In fact, the events that transformed the small peasants into wage labourers, and their means of subsistence and of labour into material elements of capital, created, at the same time, a home-market for the latter. Formerly, the peasant family produced the means of subsistence and the raw materials, which they themselves, for the most part, consumed. These raw materials and means of subsistence have now become commodities; the large farmer sells them, he finds his market in manufactures.

Peasants keep moving to where they need work until finally spinning and weaving machines conquers most of the work..

##Chapter 31: Genesis of the Industrial Capitalist
While famers had a slow rise to capitalism, industrial capitalists acted more rapidly. There were some laws by feudal governements and trade unions that stopped industry from coming in and building I guess? Eventually by force they are allowed to create a true capitalist economy, partly trhough olonialism. Accumulating labor through slavery was another form of primitive accumulation.

The public debt also plays a role, by allowing the creation of money out of almost nothign and a government built on collecting taxes to pay debts.

There are some pillars of change here that I could call back to if I wanted to, but not now.

##Chapter 32: Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation

So we see people move from slaves and serfs into wage laborers. This is really a change in form actually...

But private property has a different character. Even the laborer can start petty industry, while this also exists in slavery etc, it really grows in this form. HOwever, the old social organization keeps it down, and you need a new one that frees labor.

>That which is now to be expropriated is no longer the labourer working for himself, but the capitalist exploiting many labourers. This expropriation is accomplished by the action of the immanent laws of capitalistic production itself, by the centralisation of capital. One capitalist always kills many.

We also see everything become less technical, universally usable, and all people will eventually be caught in a world market.

>
The transformation of scattered private property, arising from individual labour, into capitalist private property is, naturally, a process, incomparably more protracted, violent, and difficult, than the transformation of capitalistic private property, already practically resting on socialised production, into socialised property. In the former case, we had the expropriation of the mass of the people by a few usurpers; in the latter, we have the expropriation of a few usurpers by the mass of the people.

I am not sure I totally follow the lines of thought here.


##Chapter 33: Modern Theory of Colonialisation
We see in western europe the process of primitive accumulation is complete, such that now you make money from other people's labor. In the colonies, we see these laborers bump up against capital:
>ious zeal and all the greater unction, the more loudly the facts cry out in the face of his ideology. It is otherwise in the colonies. There the capitalist regime everywhere comes into collision with the resistance of the producer, who, as owner of his own conditions of labour, employs that labour to enrich himself, instead of the capitalist. The contradiction of these two diametrically opposed economic systems, manifests itself here practically in a struggle between them.

In the colonies you can try to get people to work, but they still have means of subsistence from the land, and so they can see the social relation as something different than what they'd see otherwise.
