Abstract: "Semiotics offers an approach for researching and analyzing systems of meaning that undergird occupational and or- ganizational cultures. Following a synopsis of semiotic theory, this paper presents data from an ethnosemantic study of a funeral home and demonstrates that semiotically identical codes structure a funeral director's understanding of his various tasks. The analysis not only suggests that semiotic research captures the redundant themes that characterize insiders' interpretations of this workworld, but that it is also sensitive to the mundane, but critical, aspects of a culture. Finally, the study shows how semiotic research can elucidate rules by which members of a work culture consistently and coherently generate meaning"

Abstract

>Semiotics offers an approach for researching and analyzing systems of meaning that undergird occupational and or- ganizational cultures. Following a synopsis of semiotic theory, this paper presents data from an ethnosemantic study of a funeral home and demonstrates that semiotically identical codes structure a funeral director's understanding of his various tasks. The analysis not only suggests that semiotic research captures the redundant themes that characterize insiders' interpretations of this workworld, but that it is also sensitive to the mundane, but critical, aspects of a culture. Finally, the study shows how semiotic research can elucidate rules by which members of a work culture consistently and coherently generate meaning


People see culture in the same types of key terms, and it has blown up in organizational studies. But we don't often think of how they make sense of the work world - how htey construct systems of meaning.

>Over the course of this essay my intent is to show how semiotics provides one avenue for conceptualizing and analyz- ing occupational and organizational cultures. At issue is the explication of a culture by techniques that treat interpretive structures as distinct phenomena subject to their own princi- ples of operation. Broadly put, the questions to which semiotics provides a possible answer are not what what does a culture do, how did it come to be, or who shares it, but rather of what is it composed, howare its parts structured, and how does it work?p.394

Semiotics is the study of signs and systems.

>codes. To the extent that semiotics examines how meaning is constructed, its aim resembles the aims of both symbolic interactionism and ethnomethodology. Like the sym- bolic interactionists, semioticians assume that our relationship with the physical and social world is mediated by symbolic processes. Like ethnomethodology, semiotics concerns prag- matics, the investigation of rules of use by which communica- tions are produced and interpreted p.395

<def>Sign in semiotics: The relationship between a sign-vehicle (an expression or form such as work/sound) and the content conveyed by the sign vehicle</def>

The link is a convention of the group. Also, how are expressions linked to their contents?

Metonym - signification when expressions are related to content by contiguity or juxtaposition - crown means king.
Metaphor - signification by Similarity or analogy. Metonyms are both part of the same domain, metaphors are not.
Opposition - Sees things in contrast to another (red and green lights)

Signs like those above are combined into a code with four ingredients:
1. A set of expressions
2. A set of contents
3. Rules for coupling expressions to contents
4. A set of alternative responses contingent on the combination.

That last one means that behavior is a function of interpretation.

IN a chain of signification, there are two parts:
1. The denotative code - the contents immediately assoiated wiht the sign vehicle
2. The connotative code - Meaning at a more inclusive, reflexive level - generalized (it's been a strange trip)

In the connotative code, one finds "redundancies of interpretation"

He spent time at a funeral home and listened to the way people spoke. He mostly focused on interviews to get text out of people.

He then gave people decks of words and asked them to sort.

For instance, the funeral director poses a dead boddy in order to create a code for sleeping. One is supposed to suggest that corpses are sleeping people.

>Yet the purpose of posing is to suggest that corpses and sleeping people have attributes in common. Thus posing creates a metaphor by arranging for the corpse to be associated with cues (expressions) normally associated with peaceful sleep (content). Therefore, in terms of the diagram, the corpse in its posed state presumably shifts semantic domains to become aligned with its opposite p.403

But to denote sleep, one has to produce a general idea of it - They do this by doing many things that are lie sleeping.

>diagram), the code of posed features is a metonymical array of metaphorical signs for another metonym- ical array of indices used in everyday life. The code shifts the corpse from one semantic domain to another and, therefore, suggests that opposites are similar. The code's rule might be stated as: Manipulate a corpse's facial features to simulate metaphorically the metonymical system of expressions used as typical indices of sleep. p. 404

The chapel is also made to feel like a home to keep it going.

>The denotative code of furnishings is built on the following rule: choose a decor to devise an array of indices commonly as- sociated with living rooms and combine this metonymical array with an appropriate color scheme to imply metaphorically that funeral chapels and living rooms have something in common. p. 406

This is an interesting way to think about the way work is structured in a way that has been uncommon so far in our thinking about a sociology of work. But one likely could connect it to say, emotional labor.

>However, the codes do suggest that within the culture of this funeral home, employees need to be conscious of and manage the emotional tension generated by death. In order to work in the home, among other things, one would have to come to interpret events, objects, tasks, and even one's own behavior in terms of their impact on funeral participants. In particular, an apprentice must learn to structure carefully the funeral envi- ronment so as to achieve a balance between cues of life and death p.408
