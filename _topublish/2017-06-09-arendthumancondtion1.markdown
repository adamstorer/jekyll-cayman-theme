## Human Condition
### Chapter 3

The introduction to this chapter is a charming prologue to a critique of Marx that ends with the following quote:
>Certainly, I shall avoid the company of detractors of a great man. If I happen to agree with them on a single point I grow suspicious of myself - Benjamin Constant

Arendt wishes to draw a distinction between work and labor, and begins with a discussion of Locke's distinction between "working hands and a laboring body."

But also, Labor as a noun is the action, but work as a noun can be something broader. And it makes sense that laboring, in order to reproduce yourself.

Arendt is drawing on the Ancient Greek society of slaves and citizens. Ancient Greeks argued they needed slaves because of the slavish nature of the work around them. The work was classified as "slavish" and then people were found to do it. Ancient Greeks thought to labor meant to be enslaved.
>Because men were dominated by the necessities of life, they could
win their freedom only through the domination of those whom
they subjected to necessity by force.

<def>Ancient Greek Conception of Slavery: The work itself is slavish</def>

Ancient Greeks were merely trying to exclude labor from their every day life? And this distinction between work done in the home and work done in public was not made, because all activity was defined against the act of contemplation.

But even in modern society we don't see a distinction between "the labor of our body" and the "work of our hands," only productive and unproductive labor. Even Marx brings some of these distinctions, throwing off the "servant" as someone unproductive, even when they are living closer to slavery.  But there is a productivity here, even if it's futile.  

 Arendt distinguishes between the activity of thought and the activity of work or labor.  There is a distinction between the tangibility of the action that Arendt is pointing to.

#### The Thing-Character of the World
For Marx, Labor's productivity is measured against the requirements of the life process for its own reproduction, and not in something like, potential labor power or the quality of the things it produces.

IN this way, labor and work are different only in degree.  In other words, we do not distinguish between making bread or making a table, this is all labor.

Only in language do we see a difference in the character of the things that we labor for. This language teaches us that we should indeed distinguish between the two (this argument seems pretty weak but that's ok)

As we pointed out before, there is a difference again between other "products" (?) of action and speech, human relationships.  These are not only intangible but not durable. But they are stil"work" maybe? I'm not sure. But they are quite different from the THINGS that labor produces. Something else must happen for a thought or a poem to become a thing, a produced piece of paper witha  peom on it. Most things are more permanent than the activity they produce.
>Human life, in so far as it is world-building, is engaged in a constant process of reification, and the degree of worldliness of produced things, which all together form the human artifice, depends upon their greater or lesser permanence in the world itself.

#### Labor and life

Drawing on the last section, Arendt seems to be tryign to connect an argument about work and labor to an argument about the durability and tangibility. Arendt argues that those needed to reproduce life (like food) are the least durable.
They are also natural, not totally man made. What Arendt argues in this section is that Labor, in its first instance, is meant to produce the non-durable but tangible aspects of subsistence.
Arendt argues many theorists are loathe to make this distinction between two types of commodities that are produced, and the two types of work that are necessary for it.

For Marx, labor is an eternal necessity - but we also want to emancipate man from labor. But this is impossible. For Marx then, we have productive slavery and unproductive freedom.

<def>Marx's Contradiction in the Capital Volume 3: Labor is a human necessity, but true freedom is freedom from labor.</def>

<def>Locke's Notion of Labor: Labor as the origin of property, wealth, values, and humanity</def>

The question is, why does everyone hold fast to Locke's original idea? Why is it that "only labor, and neither action nor work, is unending." p.105

For Marx labor was both reproduction of one's own life - as in survival, and the production of foreign life, which assured the survival of the species. This (to me) seems based on a Hegelian notion of how labor works based on Philosophy of Right, and it could be interesting to go back and take a look at this. Marx says that there is an amount of Labor necessary for the reproduction of one's own life, and then a surplus of labor after that. But in focusing on how the process of labor develops, there is almost no focus on the "short run."

#### Privacy of Property and wealth

There is a kind of contradiction in the privacy of labor/property because it is at the same time the very private work you do to reproduce yourself, and at the same time the thing you do to bring life to the species.

There is also a contradiction in that wealth can grow infinitely (like a species) but no individual person can.  Labor that is fully public "expropriated animal laborans become no less private because he has been deprived of a private place of his own to hide and be protected from the common realm." Freedom from labor in this way, which is maybe like Marx's way, puts people into an entirely private space working on hobbies.

This section was a little strange to me.

#### The Instruments of Work and the Division of Labor - Trying to speed up this reading
>"The fact that slavery and banishment into the household was, by and large, the social condition of all laborers prior to the modern age is primarily due to the human condition itself; life, which for all other animal species is the very essence of their being, becomes a burden to man because of his innate "repugnance to futility." p.119

The question here is, how do humans weigh the difference between their current needs, their "slavish" labor-type needs of immediate reproduction, with the "loftier desires." That is, is the act of labor itself the general human condition.  
For the ancient greeks this could only be stopped by using servants and slaves to move out of this natural human condition.

>The human condition is such that pain and effort are not just symptoms which can be removed without changing life itself; they are rather the modes in which life itself, together with the necessity to which it is bound, makes itself felt. For mortals, the "easy life of the gods" would be a lifeless life. p.120

That is, a free and easy life is not so good - though I am not sure why. Possibly because you are missing out on "work."

Arendt then brings in a discussion of automation, arguing that automatic can make it more difficult for us to remember "life is slavery" (and to make the most of it as a result?) While slaves made this obvious, machines can obscure this simple fact.

>Man cannot be free if he does not know that he is subject to necessity, because his freedom is always won in his never wholly successful attempts to liberate himself from necessity.
p.121

Arendt argues that the tools that make labor easier are the product of work not labor. Essentially, we are slaves to human necessity, and labor is that activity which serves to satisfy our needs.

<def>In Labor, products are used or consumed?: Consumed </def>
<def>In Work, products are used or consumed?: Used </def>

How does planned obsolence fit in with this?

So how do we know what laboring is? For one, there is an endless repetition of action which gives laboring its character.
<def>Two aspects of laboring: Endless and Repetitive</def>

And the speeding up of production that comes with machinery makes it more difficult to distinguish between work an dlabor, partially because the difference between objects to be consumed and objects to be used are both produced so quickly that you simply feel as though you are consuming everything. As a result, we give up on their inherent durability.

>we must consume, devour,
as it were, our houses and furniture and cars as though they were
the "good things" of nature which spoil uselessly if they are not
drawn swiftly into the never-ending cycle of man's metabolism
with nature. It is as though we had forced open the distinguishing
boundaries which protected the world, the human artifice, from
nature, the biological process which goes on in its very midst as
well as the natural cyclical processes which surround it, delivering
and abandoning to them the always threatened stability of a
human world.
p.126

<def>Homo Faber: The fabricators of the world, those focused on permanence, stability, and durability</def>
<def>ideal of animal laborans: abundance</def>

#### Consumers Society
If we live in a society of consumers, then we live in a society of labors, working towards abundance rather than durability.
For instance, whatever we do for making a living.

<def>The Artist in Laboring Society: The Last "worker." Even this can turn to play in some versions of society.</def>

This leads it to a general distinction between "labor" and "leisure," where leisure is everything not necessary for the live of the individual or sustaining society.
This makes us forget that every society before us saw the act of making money as separate for the actual content of anything from science to architecture.

We do not need to do violence on humans because necessity itself does this violence.

>The danger that the modern age's emancipation of labor will not
only fail to usher in an age of freedom for all but will result, on the
contrary, in forcing all mankind for the first time under the yoke of
necessity, was already clearly perceived by Marx when he insisted
that the aim of a revolution could not possibly be the already-
accomplished emancipation of the laboring classes, but must
consist in the emancipation of man from labor
p.130

Even if machiens could automate everything - there would still be a "worldly futility of the life process"
We may not have to do hardly any laboring or consumption - so that all labor power is spent consuming. But in this case man would only "consume" the whole world.

>The danger of future automation
is less the much deplored mechanization and artificialization of
natural life than that, its artificiality notwithstanding, all human
productivity would be sucked into an enormously intensified life
process and would follow automatically, without pain or effort, its
ever-recurrent natural cycle. The rhythm of machines would magnify
and intensify the natural rhythm of life enormously, but it
would not change, only make more deadly, life's chief character
with respect to the world, which is to wear down durability.
p.131

I think in this passage Arendt means the world would be destroyed, but also maybe that it would suck.

There is a belief in Marx, Arendt argues, that when labour power is not spent on labouring it will "automatically nourish other, 'higher', activities." p.133 - But spare time is only spent on CONSUMPTION - in a laboring society.

>That these appetites become
more sophisticated, so that consumption is no longer restricted
to the necessities but, on the contrary, mainly concentrates
on the superfluities of life, does not change the character of
this society, but harbors the grave danger that eventually no object
of the world will be safe from consumption and annihilation
through consumption.
p.133

Animal laborans, those who exist in a society of labor and focus mostly on consumption, are not focused on the public realm that Marx sees as the end of a reduction in working time.

For workers on the other hand, those who "build the world," only the work put into something gives it value.

Arendt ends the chapter with this quote:
>The danger is that such a society, dazzled by the abundance of its
growing fertility and caught in the smooth functioning of a neverending
process, would no longer be able to recognize its own futility—
the futility of a life which "does not fix or realize itself in any
permanent subject which endures after [its] labour is past."135
