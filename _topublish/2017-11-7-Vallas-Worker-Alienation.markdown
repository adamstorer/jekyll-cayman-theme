Abstract: "The introduction of new technologies into the advanced capitalist work process continues to provoke sharp theoretical debate. While mainstream theories predict an upgrading of work content, recent Marxist analyses argue that workplace automation tends to deepen the subordination of the worker beneath the means of production. This study aims to adjudicate between these rival perspectives. The analysis centers upon the communications industry in the United States, a highly automated knowledge industry rapidly undergoing the transition to competitive market conditions. Official statistics on the changing occupational structure of this industry, combined with survey data on job content, indicate the existence of an upgrading effect between 1950 and 1980. In more recent years, however, the onset of a deskilling trend is found: The more automated the workplace, the less autonomous and conceptually demanding the job tends to be. Further analysis suggests that workplace automation differentially affects the various occupational categories."

Vallas's notion of mainstream ideas is that modernizing work processes upgrades the worker's position by increasing the level of freedom and responsibility inherent in the job. Others argue automation deepens the worker's subordination to the job. Vallas has a regression and a case study.

The classical hypothesis is that as machines become automated you eventually stop doing boring stuff for them and start doing much more interesting work, "controlling the controls"

However, Braverman argues that emancipatory potential is thwarted by capitalists who take away any joy. Automation leads to even more deskilling and makes the person more subordinate than ever.

Vallas studies the communications industry. The survey was given to unions to distribute to telecommunication offices. WE have something like 1500 workers.  Vallas must try and make sense of the degree of automation here.

Ultimately it doesn't seem like it needs to be one or the other, as the organization will ultimately mediate whatever trends we see.

Work autonomy - the extent to which workers are free to direct the manner and pace of their work.
Conceptual Content - the extent to which the job requires independent thought or judgement, rather than the labor of execution alone.

These are the two outcomes vallas focuses on.

What is alienation from work?
<def>Alienation for Vallas in his study: an instrumental orientation to the job, a lack of subjective involvement in the work, an inversion of the worker/tool relationship, an aversion toward the work</def>

Vallas sees more craft work as more automation allows for expansion and the work of expansion (installing new phone lines) is relatively autonomous. WE see that through survey data it seems that there is an upgrading trend, but there is also a downgrading trend.  It seems that overall automation makes jobs worse. Looking within occupation, we see that automation effects different occupations differently. this is the point here.

The data suggest the emergence of an overall degradation trend, but the story is really more complex, since it depends very much on occupational categories. "New technologies operate in ways that are more differentiated than eitehr thery acknowledges. "
