## Introduction

Doing ethnography is like being a blind person that learns to see, you need to make sense out of something for the first time that does not make sense on its own.

The central question of social anthropology is classification.
>When the ethnographer visits a strange people he carries with him such concepts as ‘god’,
‘power’, ‘debt’, ‘family’, ‘gift’, and so on, and however thorough his professional preparation
he will tend at first to look for and identify what his own culture denotes by these words
and to interpret the statements of the people in terms of them. intro 8-9

This was the introduction by someone else! Ignoring...

## The Problem

We do not realize the categories we use are idiosyncratic and not immediately given to all people.

We might assume some interrelation or hierarchy of concepts but these are socially constructed.

Even the category of the self has some mental confusion, as people conflate themselves with some kind of totem.

>Far, then, from man classifying spontaneously and by a sort of natural necessity, humanity
in the beginning lacks the most indispensable conditions for the classificatory function.
Further, it is enough to examine the very idea of classification to understand that man could
not have found its essential elements in himself. p.4

Durkheim then does some bs logic gto argue that classification has a hierarchy that doens'tmake sense to us from anywhere, so we have to figure out where it comes from. This to me seems like it doesn't have to be true. For Durkheim we always have to go back to the most primitive version to understand the current version. This is a method/belief that pretty much noone has these days.

He then goes on to look at the aboriginal case, in which certain types of tribes were very popular . In this case, a tribe would classify some sort of stuff as its stuff and would only use that stuff for whatever it needed.

>When the classification is made simply by moieties,
without any further sub-division, everyone regards himself as a relative, and equally a relative,
of the beings attributed to the moiety of which he is a member; they are all, by the
same title, his flesh, his friends, whereas he has quite other feelings about the beings of the
other moiety. But when a division into classes or clans is superimposed on to this fundamental
division, these kinship relations are differentiated. Thus a Kumite of Mount Gambier
feels that everything Kumite is his; but some are closer in that they are of his totem.
The kinship, in this latter case, is more close. ‘The class name is general,’ says Howitt; ‘the
totem name is, in one sense, individual, for it is certainly nearer to the individual than the
name of the moiety of the community to which he belongs.’1 Things are thus conceived
as disposed in a series of concentric circles around the individual; the more distant, those
which correspond to the widest genera, are those comprising things which touch him least;
they become progressively differentiated as they close in upon him. Thus, when they are
foodstuffs, it is only the closest which are forbidden to him. p.14

And as a summary:
>To sum up, though we may not be justified in saying that this way of classifying things
is necessarily implied by totemism, it is certain, in any case, that it is found very often in
societies organized on a totemic basis. There is thus a close link, and not an accidental
relation, between the social system and this logical system. We shall now see how other
forms of classification, presenting a higher degree of complexity, may be connected to this
primitive form. p.24


<def>Durkheim's Idea of Classification: Classifications are products of social systems. Original classifications are between the self and the other (my clan vs your clan) and all other categories stem from the social system</def>

For instance in China:
>The four seasons correspond
to the four regions. Moreover, each of these regions is sub-divided into six parts, and the
twenty-four subdivisions give naturally the twenty-four seasons of the Chinese year

## Conclusions
WHat do primitive classifications have?
1. Hierarchized notions- things stand in fixed relationship to each other to form a single whole.
2. Speculative - They are not to guide action but to advance understanding..
3. Social!

>We have seen, indeed, how these classifications were modelled on the closest and most
fundamental form of social organization. This, however, is not going far enough. Society
was not simply a model which classificatory thought followed; it was its own divisions
which served as divisions for the system of classification. The first logical categories were
social categories; the first classes of things were classes of men, into which these things
were integrated. It was because men were grouped, and thought of themselves in the form
of groups, that in their ideas they grouped other things, and in the beginning the two modes
of grouping were merged to the point of being indistinct. p.49

And moreover
>We thus arrive at this conclusion: it is possible to classify other things than concepts,
and otherwise than in accordance with the laws of pure understanding. For in order for it to
be possible for ideas to be systematically arranged for reasons of sentiment, it is necessary
that they should not be pure ideas, but that they should themselves be products of sentiment.
And in fact, for those who are called primitives, a species of things is not a simple
object of knowledge but corresponds above all to a certain sentimental attitude. p. 50


But then there is this section which is kind of hard to make sense of:
>Things are above all sacred or profane, pure or impure, friends or enemies,
favourable or unfavourable;1 i.e. their most fundamental characteristics are only expressions
of the way in which they affect social sensibility.

But these categories exist? Or social groups produce these categories?
