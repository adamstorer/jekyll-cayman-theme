Where does the taste of cultural goods come from? Some ideology of charisma sees taste as a legitimate natural gift, but scientific observation shows cultural needs are the product of upbringing and education.

Home background and formal education lead to taste being a function of class. Tastes are not only produced by class but used by class.

Individuals in the cultural field seek nobility and pedigree awarded by the educational system, and success in this field is based on a struggle.

In understanding art, one must have a kind of cultural knowledge.
>A work of art has meaning and interest
only for someone who possesses the cultural competence, that is, the
code, into which it is encoded. The conscious or unconscious implementation
of explicit or implicit schemes of perception and appreciation
which constitutes pictorial or m usical culture is the hidden condition for
recognizing the styles characteristic of a period, a school or an author,
and, more generally, for the familiarity with the internal logic of works
that aesthetic enjoyment presupposes. A beholder who lacks the specific
code feels lost in a chaos of sounds and rhythms, colours and lines, without
rhyme or reason. p. 2

If you learn culture early enough, you almost forget you have the language at all. There is an aesthetic disposition that goes beyond art.

To begin studying taste one has to put the thing itself in a different world, and study instead the x.

>The denial of lower, coarse, vulgar, venal, servile-in a word, oatural--e
nj oyment , which constitu tes the sacred sphere of culture, implies
an affirmation of the superiority of those who can be satisfied with the
sublimated, refined, disin terested, gratuitous, distinguished pleasu res forever
closed to the profane. That is why art and cultural consumption are
predisposed, consciously and deliberately or not, to fulfil a social function
of legitimating social differences. p.7

# A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste

## Aristocracy of Culture

Taste is vital for he dominant class because it is a supreme manifestation of discernment, and because every rule of propriety designates in advance the project of defining this essence, and the upperclass propriety which treats taste as the surest signof nobility.

*this is a pretty strong version of the argument*

There is a structure of objective positions which leads to outcomes in the field.

Bourdieu then goes on to make some claims about his survey of 1000 people. Here is a brief outline of his argument:

>Thus, of all the objects offered for consumers' choice, there are none
more classifying than legitimate works of an, which, while distinctive in
general, enable the production of distinctions ad infinitum by play ing on
divisions and sub-divisions into genres, periods, styles, authors etc.
Within the universe of particular tastes which can be recreated by successive
divisions, it is thus possible, still keeping to the major oppositions,
to distinguish three zones of taste which roughly correspond to
educational levels and social classes: ( 1 ) Legitimate taste, i .e., the taste for
legitimate works, here represented by the Well- Tempered Clavier ( see figure
1 , histogram 1 ) , the Art of Fugue or the Concerto for the Left Hand, or,
in painting, Breughel or Goya, which the most self-assured aesthetes can
combine with the most legitimate of the arts that are still in the process
of legitimation ---cinema, jazz or even song ( here, for example, Uo Ferre,
Jacques Douai )-increases with educational level and is highest in those
fractions of the dominant class that are richest in educational capi tal . ( 2 )
'Middle-brow' taste, which brings together the minor works of the major
arts, in this case Rhapsody in Blue ( h istogram 2 ) , the Hungarian Rhapsody,
or in painting, Utrillo, Buffet or even Renoir, and the major works of the
m i n o r arts, s u c h as Jacques Brei and Gilbert Beca u d in the art of song, is
more common in the middle classes (classes moyennes ) than in the worki
ng classes (classes popu/aires ) or in the 'intellectual' fractions of the dominant
class. ( 3 ) Finally, 'popular' taste, represented here by the choice of
works of so-called 'light' music or classical music deval ued by popularization,
such as the Blue Danube ( h istogram 3 ) , La Traviata or L 'Ariesienne,
and especially songs totally devoid of artistic ambition or pretension such
as those of Luis Mariano, Guetary or Petula Clark, is most frequent
among the working classes and varies in inverse ratio to educational capital p


So we get legitimate taste, middle-brow taste, and popular taste, dispositions towards cultural products that are associated with education and class.

#### Titles of Cultural Nobility

It is a question why music or painting, which are distance from education as such, are so predictive of education.

>Again, t o understand the class distribu tion of the various spans, one
would have to take accoun t of the representation which , in terms of their
specific schemes of perception a n d apprec i a t i o n , the differe n t c lasses h ave
of the costs ( economic, cul tural and 'physical' ) and benefi ts attached to
the different sports---im mediate or deferred 'physical ' benefi ts ( heal th,
beau ty, strength, whether visible, through 'body-building' or i nvisible
th rough 'keep-fi t' exercises ) , economic and social benefi ts ( upward mobility
etc. ) , im mediate or deferred symbol ic benefi ts linked to the distribu
tional or posi tional value of each of the sportS considered ( i .e. , all that
each of them receives from i ts greater or lesser rari ty, and i ts more or
less clear association with a class, with boxing, football, rugby or bodybuilding
evoking the working classes, tennis and skiing the bourgeoisie
and golf the upper bourgeoisie) , gains i n distinction accruing from the
effects on the body i tself ( e.g. , slimness, sun-tan, muscles obviously or
discreetly visible etc. ) or from the access to highly selective groups which
some of these sports give ( golf, polo etc. ) . p. 20

*I still think this is an over statement of the case*  

People think too little about the component parts of people (age) as something separate from the person, a separate force. Really you only get common sense effects from this.

#### Entitlement Effect
Because cultural capital is given from the family and academic capital is closely tied to cultural capital, it is har to really draw out the differences between the two.
>Academic capital is in fact the guaranteed product of the combined
effects of cultural transmission by the family and cultural
transmission by the school  p.23

Academics create a TRANSPOSABLE disposition towards legitimate culture. It starts with a scholastic knowledge but moves beyond it.

But cultural appropriation also needs titles - some type of status. That is, different academic markers.

But to be fully cultivated you move beyond the agreed upon rules, the agreed upon regulations.

Education, then, creates the disposition by which cultural capital functions, because as people move beyond the status markers created by education, they add new things, cultural things.
>Thus, it is written into the tacit definition of the academic qualification
formally guaranteeing a specific competence (like an engineering diploma)
that it really guaran tees possession of a 'general culture' whose
breadth is proportionate to the prestige of the qualification ;9 and, conversely,
that no real guaran tee may be sough t of what it guaran tees formally
and real ly or, to pu t it another way, of the exten t to which it
guaran tees what it guaran tee p.25

During schooling we see a manipulation of aspirations and demands -channeling pupils towards prestigious or devalued positions.

>This logic doubtless helps to explain how the legitimate disposition
that is acquired by frequent contact with a particular cl ass of works,
namely, the literary and philosophical works recognized by the academic
canon, comes to be extended to other, less legitimate works, such as
avant-garde literature, or to areas enjoying less academic recognition ,
such a s the cinema. p.26

<def>The Generalizing Tendency: In Bourdieu's Distinction, the generalizing tendency is the tendency to transpose your dispositions onto other spheres. For instance, we see philosophical works that are given status in education come to influence film. It allows us to recognize legitimate works in different fields.</def>

>This expl ains why the propensity and capacity to accu mulate
'gratuitous' knowledge, such as the names of film directors, are more
closely and excl usively linked to educational capital than is mere cinemagoing,
which is more dependent on income, pl ace of residence and age. p. 26s

This doesn't even necessarily mean thinking about cinema as a new field to study. Instead it comes from "unintentional learning made possible by a disposition acquired through domestic or scholastic inculcation of legitimate culture." p.28

<def>What is the entitlement effect?: </def>

#### Aesthetic Disposition
Legitimate work impose norms by which you can understand its legitimacy. Some people do not have the capability of measuring the norms.
>Does this mean that the demarcation l ine between the world o f technical
objects and the world of aesthetic objects depends on the 'intention'
of the producer of those objects ? In fact, this 'intention' is itself the product
of the social norms and conventions which combine to define the
always uncertain and historically changing frontier between simple technical
objects and objets d'art p.29

That is, there is the creators intention. But there is also the beholders intension.
>To break out of this circle one only has to observe
that the ideal of 'pure' perception of a work of art qua work of art is
the product of the enunciation and systematization of the principles of
speci fically aesthetic legitimacy which accompany the constituting of a
relatively autonomous artistic field. The aesthetic mode of perception in
the 'pure' form wh ich it has now assu med corresponds to a particular
state of the mode of artistic production p.30

#### Pure Taste and Barbarous Taste
One works hard to develop the aesthetic disposition, but then one gets to think they have some kind of self-legitimated pure taste which is better than the masses.

#### Popular Aesthetic
There is some notion that the popular aesthetic is based on the continuity between art and life, and the more developed your aesthetic disposition is, the more you can draw distinctions between these things.

There is some thrust here towards a genuine appreciation of things, but think about the false enforcement of norms and marcel du champ. Maybe it's all just made up.

>Formal refinement-which, i n literature or the theatre, leads to obscurity-
is, in the eyes of the working-class public, one sign of what is sometimes
felt to be a desire to keep the u ninitiated at arm's length, p.33

#### Aesthetic Distancing

<def>Aesthetic Distancing: When someone with a defined aesthetic disposition turns it onto something that was of popular taste, they distance themselves from popular taste by comparing it using criteria outside of popular taste and including it in a set of things people don't know much about The distancing is also a kind of distance in form from the things that people care about. A painting of a cabbage rather than one of a first communion.</def>

>Detachment, disin teres tedness, indifference-aesthetic
theory has so often presented these as the only way to recognize the work
of art for what it is, au tonomous, selbstdndig, that one ends up forgetting
that they really mean disinvestment, detachment, indifference, in other
words, the refusal to invest oneself and take thinps seriously...Thus one finds that
the higher the level of education,26 the greater is the proportion of responden
ts who, when asked whether a series of objects would make
beau tiful photographs, refuse the ordinary objects of popular admiration-
a first communion, a sunset or a landscape-as 'vulgar' or 'ugly', or
reject them as 'trivial ', silly, a bit 'wet', or, in Ortega y Gasset's terms,
naively 'h uman'; and the greater is the proportion who assert the au tonomy
of the representation with respect to the thing represen ted by declaring
that a beau tiful photograph, and a fortiori a beautiful painting,
can be made from objects socially designated as meaning1ess-a metal
frame, the bark of a tree, and especially cabbages, p.35

>Thus, nothing more rigorously distingu ishes the different cl asses than
the disposition objectively demanded by the legitimate consumption of
leg iti mate works, the apti tude for taking a spec i fically aesthetic poi n t of
view on objects al ready constitu ted aesthetically-and therefore put
forward for the admiration of those who have learned to recogn ize the
signs of the admi rable-and the even rarer capacity to consti tute aesthetically
objects that are ordinary or even 'common' ( beGause they are appropriated,
aesthetically or o therwise, by the 'common people' ) or to apply
the principles of a 'pure' aesthetic in the most everyday choices of everyday
l i fe, in cooking, d ress or decoration, for example. p. 40

#### An Anti-Kantian Aesthetic

Working class people expect things to fulfil some aesthetic, that which pleases. But that which gratifies is something "greater" and must be something more disinterested.
>The value of a photograph is measured
by the in terest of the information it conveys, and by the clarity
with which it fulfils this informative function, in short, its legibili ty ,
which i tself varies with t h e legibili ty of i ts intention or function, the
j udgemen t it provokes being more or less favou rable depending on the
expressive adequacy of the signi fier to the signified. p. 43

*This is mostly just making me want to read Kant!*

#### Aesthetics, Ethics, and Aestheticism
If one lacks the competence to make sense of a work of art transpose one from their everday existence - and these are opposed to the aesthetic disposition.

>Thus the easiest, and so the most frequent
and most spectacular way to 'shock (pater) the bourgeois' by
proving the extent of one's power to confer aesthetic status is to transgress
ever more radically the ethical censorships ( e.g., in matters of sex )
w hich the o ther classes accept even within the area which the dominant
disposition defines as aesthetic. Or, more subtly, i t is done by conferring
aesthetic status on objects or ways of representing them that are excluded
by the dominant aesthetic of the time, or on objects that are given aesthetic
status by dominated 'aesthetics'. p.47

In other words, it is kind of a symbolic transgression that some high status people make by including low status works of art as popular.

>The pure disposition is so universally recognized as· legi timate that no
voice is heard pointing out that the defini tion of art, and through it the
art of living, is an object of s truggle among the classes. p. 48

*I mean, if it is transposable there are limits, right? Consider the opulent houses people live in. This type of distinction through difference is a strange case.*

#### Neutralization and the Universe of Possibles

Aesthetic perception helps to pick out elements of something, relocate them in stylistic universes, and see them as such.

>The aesthetic disposition, understood as the aptitude for perceiving
and deciphering specifically styl istic characteristics, is thus inseparable
from specifically artistic competence. The latter may be acqu ired by expl
icit learning or si mply by regular contact with works of art, especi al lv
those assembled in museums and galleries. p.50

>This practical
mastery enables its possessor to situate each element of a universe of artistic
representations in a class defined in relation to the class composed
of all the artistic representations consciously or unconsciously excluded. p.52

#### Distance from Necessity

Educational capital is correlated with the propensity to appreciate a  work indepent of its content (instead on its form, i.e. disinterestedly). Schooling helps, but there is also a field of cultural capital that has a history. It is also part of a general history in which art and aesthetics play a part.

To focus on this is to suspend an interest in economic necessity and distance onself from partical urgencies

>To be able to play the games of culture with the playful seriousness
which Plato demanded, a seriousness withou t the 'spiri t of seriousness',
one has to belong to the ranks of those who have been able, not necessarily
to make their whole existence a sort of children's game, as artists do,
but at least to maintain for a long time, sometimes a whole lifetime, a
child's relation to the world. p. 54

>The aesthetic disposition, a generalized capacity to neutralize ordinary
u rgencies and to bracket off p ractical ends, a durable inclination and aptitude
for practice without a practical function, can only be constituted
within an experience of the world freed from urgency and through the
practice of activities which are an end in themselves, such as scholastic
exercises or the contemplation of works of art. In other words, i t presupposes
the distance from the world ( of which the 'role distance' brough t
to l ight by Erving Goffman is a particular case ) which is the basis of the
bou rgeois experience of the world. p. 54

Economic power is the power to keep economic necessity at arm's length.
*What about the starving artist? The kid working at the cafe to pursue their art into their 30s*

#### Aesthetic Sense as the Sense of Distinction

One with an aethetic disposition is part of an overall way to distance themselves from the world.
>It is one manifestation of the system of dispositions produced by
the social conditionings associated with a particular class of conditions of
existence when they take the paradoxical form of the greatest freedom
conceivable, at a given moment, with respect to the constraints of economic
necessity. But it is also a distinctive expression of a privileged position
in social space whose distinctive value is objectively established in
its relationship to expressions generated from different conditions. Like
every sort of taste, it unites and separates. p. 56

It helps to unite those who have the same class background.

Thus, tastes are the manifestation of difference.

>Aversion
to different life-styles is perhaps one of the strongest barriers between the
classes; class endogamy is evidence of this. The most intolerable thing for
those who regard themselves as the possessors of legitimate culture is the
sacrilegious reuni ting o f tastes which taste dictates shall be separated .
This means that the games of artists and aesthetes and their struggles for
the monopoly of artistic legiti macy are less innocent than they seem. At
stake in every struggle over art there is also the imposition of an art of
living, that is, the transmutation of an arbitrary way of living into the
legitimate way of life which casts every o ther way of living into arbitrariness.

The petite bourgeois also serve a function as the incoming class who mount a credible threat to the legitimacy of the work.

There is also a middle brow art which I think is an elevation of the form of popular tastes but without the true disinterestedness of highbrow art. That is, a middle class taste defies the vulga popular music but are also not interested in intellectual songs..

### Cultural Pedigree

Differences in social origin, (holding education constant) are assocated iwth differences in competence. Competence both in terms of overall knowledge and knowledge of those types of culture outside of the scholastic type of education.

*Liberals and Lattes is a really different version of this argument. Things don't serve a purpose, more basic aspects of human tastes work together to create distinct groups.*

One can see the differences in taste that come from differences in social origin as we move away from Culture:
>The differences linked to social origin tend to increase as
one moves away from the academic curriculum, from li terature to painting
or classical music and a fortiori jazz or avant-garde art. p. 65

>Those who have acquired the bulk of their cultural capital i n and for
school have more 'classical', safer cultural investments than those who have
received a large cultural inheritance p. 65

#### Manners and Manner of Acquisition
>what are grasped through indicators such as educational
level or social origin or, more precisely, in the structure of the relationship
between them, are also different modes of production of the cultivated
habitus, which engender differences not only in the competences
acquired but also in the manner of applying them . p. 66

>Thus, for example, in place
of practical schemes of classification, which are always partial and linked
to practical contexts, it puts explicit, standardized taxonomies, fixed once
and for all in the form of synoptic schemas or dualistic typologies (e.g.,
'classical'j'romantic' ) , which are expressly inculcated and therefore conserved
in the memory as knowledge that can be reproduced in virtually
identical form by all the agents subjected to i ts action. p.67

School rationalizes and makes legible art, like teaching grammar, but there is also a kind of cultural naturalization of difference. And this cultural idea is experienced as a kind of natural gift, an inherent taste.

<def>What is the ideology of natural taste?: In all aspects of life, we often naturalize real differences converting differences in the mode of acquisition of culture into differences of nature. The ideology of natural taste only recognizes legitimate works as those which can only be appreciated with a natural eye, rather than through learning. Distinction p68</def>

>' Taste must not be confused with gastronomy. Whereas taste is the natural
gift of recognizing and loving perfection, gastronomy is the set of
rules which govern the cultivation and education of taste. Gastronomy is
to taste as grammar and literature are to the literary sense p. 68

So, we have a distinction between SCHOLARS and GENTLEMEN.

#### Experience and Knowledge
>Those who invoke experience
against knowledge have a basis for their prejudice in the real opposition
between the domestic learning and the scholastic learning of culture. p.74

There is a kind of antithesis between the learn-ed and the cultur-ed
>In this antithesis
between two relations to music which are aways defined, more unconsciously
than consciously, in relation to each other-the taste for the artists
of the past, Panzera or Cortot, loved even for their imperfections
which evoke the freedom of the amateur, implies a distaste for modern
performers and their impeccable recordings for mass production--one
again finds the old opposition between the docre, who is bound
to the code ( in every sense) , the rules, and therefore the Insti tu tion
and Criticism, and the hedonistic mondain, who, being on the side
of nature, the 'natural' , is content to feel and enjoy, and who expels
all trace of intellectualism, didacticism, pedantry from his artistic
expenence. p. 76

You might also get your stuff based on your culture.

>And i t is probably i n tastes i n food that one would find the strongest
and most indelible mark of infant learning, the lessons which longest
withstand the distancing or collapse of the native world and most durably
maintain nostalgia for it. The native world is, above all, the maternal
world, the world of primordial tastes and basic foods, of the archetypal
relation to the archetypal cultural good, in which pleasure-giving is an
integral part of pleasure and of the selective disposition towards pleasure
which is acquired through pleasure. p.79

This is essentially a difference between **INHERITED** and **ACQUIRED** Capital.

>Because of the long hysteresis of the mode
of acquisition, the same educational qualifications may guarantee quite
different relations to culture-but decreasingly so, as one rises in the
educational hierarchy and as more value comes to be set on ways of using
knowledge and less on merely knowing. If the same volume of educational
capital ( guaranteed cultural capi tal ) may correspond to different
volumes of socially profitable cultural capital, this is first because although
the educational system, by i ts monopoly of certification, governs
the conversion of inherited cultural capital into educational capital , it
does not have a monopoly on the production of cultural capital p.80

>It follows from this that the differences connected
with social trajectory and the volume of inherited cultural capital are
reinforced by differences, mainly visible among members of the petite
bourgeoisie who are themselves born into the petite bourgeoisie or
drawn from the working classes ( and particularly represented in the established
petite bourgeoisie ) , which reflect changes in the state of the relations
between the educational system and the class structure. To these
different modes 0/ generation correspond different relations to the educational
system which are expressed in different strategies of cultural investment
not guaranteed by the educational institution p.83

*I am getting lost a bit, but I am seeing basically an enumeration of the ways in which cultural capital and education may differ from one another.*

#### Two Markets

One, in a sense, has, based on their acquisition of an aesthetic disposition, a sense for sound cultural investment.

>By contrast, 'middle-ground' arts such as cinema, jazz, and, even more,
strip cartoons, science fiction or detective stories are predisposed to attract
the investments either of those who have entirely succeeded in converting
their cultural capital into educational capital or those who, not
having acquired legitimate culture in the legitimate manner ( i .e.,
through early familiarization ) , maintain an uneasy relationship with it,
subjectively or objectively, or both. These arts, not yet fully legitimate,
which are disdained or neglected by the big holders of educational capital,
offer a refuge and a revenge to those who, by appropriating them, secure
the best return on their cultural capital ( especially if it is not fully
recognized scholastically) while at the same time taking credit for contesting
the established hierarchy of legitimacies and profits. In other
words, the propensity to apply to the middle-ground arts a disposition
usually reserved for the legitimate arts-that measured, for example, by
knowledge of film directors-depends less closely on educational capital
than on a whole relationship to scholastic culture and the educational
system which i tself depends on the degree to which the cultural capital
possessed consists solely of the capital acquired in and recognized by the
educational system. 87-8

The scholastic market, in part, devalues the cultural knowledge one gains through family.

#### Factors and Powers

So, a difficulty in analyzing education level, social origin, and culture, is because they are often in struggle with each other, but also in cahoots.

>The principles of logical division which statistics uses to produce its
classes and the data i t records about them are therefore also principles of
'socio-logical' division. The statistical variations associated with the ( naively
defined ) two main variables􀂢ducational level and social origincan
only be correctly interpreted so long as it is remembered that they are
bound up with antagonistic definitions of legitimate culture and of the
legitimate relation to culture, or, more precisely, with different markets,
in which the characteristics associated with one or the other are given different
prices. p.94

# The Economy of Practices

## The Social Space and its Transformations

Really we can see culture and different cultural tastes as part of a social sphere. Tastes vary in necessary ways that are tied to social and economic conditions of production.

>One only has to ask the
question, which economists strangely ignore, of the economic conditions
of the production of the dispositions demanded by the economy, i.e., in
this case," the question of the economic and social determinants of tastes,
to see the necessity of including in the complete definition of the product
the differential experiences which the consumers have of it as a function
of the dispositions they derive from their position in · economic
space. p.101

### Class Condition and Social Conditioning

There is a unity hidden under the diversity of fields which is habuts and capital plus field equals practice. HOw are homogeneous agents (class in itself) produced such that they have specific dispositions, a class habitus. We must remember that certain groups are bound together in certain ways.

There is a lot of diversity potential in practice, but there is a network of factors forcing practice into certain modes. People develop strategies of action based on the groups they are a part of and where they fit in relationally within that group.

People are in a certain social space at a moment, and practices are based partially on their positions within the space in the field, but there is also some underlying dispositions, and people also move on trajectories over time.

<def>What is the trajectory effect?: People are channeled towards positions which fit their dispositions.</def>

>In contrast to the effect of individual trajec tory, which, being a deviation
from the collective traj ectory ( that may have a zero slope) , is immediately
visible, the effect of collective trajectory may not be noticed as
such. When the trajectory effect concerns a whole class or class fraction,
that is, a set of individuals who occupy an iden tical posi tion and are engaged
in the same collective trajectory, the one which defines a rising
or declining class, there is a danger of attribu ting to the properties synchronically
attached to the class, effects ( e.g., political or religious opinions)
which are in reality the product of collective transformations p. 112

#### Capital and the Market

We start with some position and see that it is mostly of a certain class background, and we realize then that a peron's place, their position, is due to their class background but also agency which sets them on a trajectory that is somewhere in relation to their class status.

Economics is always biggest predictor, but in different fields different types of capital (which in the last instance are tied to economic capital but may not be) are important.

>one only has to see that, because capital is a social relation, i.e., an energy
which only exists and only produces its effects in the field in which it is
produced and reproduced, each of the properties attached to class is given
its value and efficacy by the specific laws of each field. In practice, that is,
in a particular field, the properties, internalized in dispositions or objectified
in economic or cultural goods, which are attached to agents are not
all simultaneously operative; the specific logic of the field determines
those which are valid in this market, which are pertinent and active in
the game in question, and which, in the relationship with this field,
function as specific capital-and, consequently, as a factor explaining
practices. This means, concretely, that the social rank and specific power
which agents are assigned in a particular field depend firstly on the
specific capital they can mobilize, whatever their additional wealth in
other types of capital ( though this may also exert an effect of contamination
) .

That is, the field is a mediator.

### A Three Dimensional Space

>The primary differences, those which distinguish the major classes of
conditions of existence, derive from the overall vol ume of capi tal , understood
as the set of actually usable resou rces and powers--economic
capi tal , cultural capi tal and also social capital. The distribution of the differen
t classes ( and class fractions ) thus runs from those who are best
provided with both economic and cultural capital to those who are most
deprived in both respects p. 114

There are differences in the total volume of capital, which are usually more important than the distribution of the different types of capital. s

If one looks at rarity of position, and the proporition of those from the dominant class, we see that this is pretty mcuh the opposite of economic capital.

There is somethign about, the proportion of cultural to economic capital increases as one moves to lower status industries.

Social mobility, then, does not take into account the fact that higher positions are help by fancier people?

>Projection onto a single axis, in order to construct the continuous, linear,
homogeneous, one-dimensional series with which the social hierarchy
is normally identified, implies an extremely difficult ( and, if it is
unwitting, extremely dangerous) operation, whereby the different types
of capital are reduced to a single standard. This abstract operation has an
objective basis in the possibility, which is always available, of converting
one type of capital into another; however, the exchange rates vary in accordance
with the power relation between the holders of the different
forms of capital. By obliging one to formulate the principle of the convertibility
of the different kinds of capital, which is the precondition for
reducing the space to one dimension, the construction of a two-dimensional
space makes it clear that the exchange rate of the different kinds of
capital is one of the fundamental stakes in the struggles between class
fractions whose power and privileges are linked to one or the other of
these types. p.125

### Reconversion Strategies
There are reproduction strategies where people do things consciously and unconsciouslly to at lest maintain their position.

But there are different ways in which building one type of capital leads to other ytpes.

>The reconversion of capital held in one form to another,
more accessible, more profi table or more legitimate form tends to induce
a transformation of asset structure. p.131

You cannot study mobility in terms of economic information because there are three different types of capital, and really in different spheres the different types of these types of capital can be convereted all into economic capital in different ways.

We also must ask, what is the dominant capital IN THE FIELD AT HAND.

>When class fractions who previously made l ittle use of the school system
enter the race for academic qualifications, the effect is to force the
groups whose reproduction was mainly or exclusively achieved through
education to step up their investments so as to maintain the relative scarcity
of their qualifications and, consequen tly, their position in the class
structure. Academic qualifications and the school system which awards
them thus become one of the key stakes in an interclass competition
which generates a general and continuous growth in the demand for
education and an inflation of academic qualifications. p. 133

>It is clear that what an academic qualification guarantees is much more
than, and different from, the right to occupy a position and the capacity
to perform the corresponding job. In this respect the diploma (titre 5COlaire)
is more like a patent of nobility (titre de noblesse) than the title to
property (titre de propriitej which strictly technical definitions make of it.
So one can well understand that the victims of devaluation are disinclined
to perceive and acknowledge the devaluing of qualifications with
which they are closely identified, both objectively (they constitute an
important part of these people's social identity) and subjectively p.142

>Reconversion strategies are nothing other than an aspect of the permanent
actions and reactions whereby each group strives to maintain or
change i ts position in the social structure, or, more precisely-at a stage
in the evol ution of class societies in which one can conserve only by
changing-to change so as to conserve. Frequently the actions whereby
each class ( or class fraction ) works to win new advantages, i.e., to gain
an advantage over the o ther classes and so, objectively, to reshape the
structure of objective relations between the classes ( the relations revealed
by the statistical distribu tions of properties ) , are compensated for ( and so
cancelled out ordinall y ) by the reactions of the other classes, directed toward
the same objective. p.157

## The Habitus and the Space of Life-Styles

>the agents have points of view on this
objective space which depend on their position within it and in which
their will to transform or conserve it is often expressed. p. 169

When speaking about people's habitus and their own thinking:
>sociologists almost always forget that
the 'objects' they classify produce not only objectively classifiable practices
but also classifying operations that are no less objective and are
themselves classifiable. p. 169

The habitus is the generative principle of objectively classfiable judgements and the system of classification of these practices.  As such, people can produce classifiable practices,  and differentiate and appreciate these practices and products.

>The
habitus is necessity internalized and converted into a disposition that
generates meaningful practices and meaning-giving perceptions; it is a
general, transposable disposition which carries out a systematic, universal
application-beyond the limits of what has been directly learnt-of the
necessity inherent in the learning conditions. That is why an agen t's
whole set of practices (or those of a whole set of agents produced by similar
conditions ) are both systematic, inasmuch as they are the product of
the application of identical ( or interchangeable ) schemes, and systematically
distinct from the practices constituting another life-style p. 170

>contrary to the illusion of the spon taneous generation of
consciousness which so many theories of the 'awakening of class consciousness'
(prise de conscience ) amount to--that primary cogn ition is
misrecogni tion, recogn i tion of an order which is also establ ished in the
mind. Life-styles are thus the systematic products of habitus, which, perceived
in theif mu tual relations through the schemes of the habi tus, become
sign systems that are socially qualified ( as 'disti nguished', 'vulgar'
etc. ) . The dialectic of conditions and habitus is the basis of an alchemy
which transforms the distribution of capital, the balance-sheet of a power
relation, into a system of perceived differences, distinctive properties, that
is, a distribution of symbolic capi tal, legitimate capi tal, whose objective
tru th is misrecogni zed p.

>Bearing in mind all that precedes, in particular the fact that the generative
schemes of the habitus are applied, by simple transfer, to the most
dissimilar areas of practice, one can immediately understand that the
practices or goods associated with the different classes in the different
areas of practice are organized in accordance with structures of opposition
which are homologous to one another because they are all homologous
to the structure of objective oppositions between class condi tions p.175

Page 176 is basically supposed to be the hole argument:
The opposition between the refined and the vulgar, highbrow and popular, is specificed according to capital composition. That is because people's objective position is part of the production both of things and of tastes. And in addition, there are some very functional relations, where the highest demand the farthest from the lowest, that is, the opposite of the hedonistic.

>While i t is clear that art offers it the greatest scope, there is no area of
practice in which the intention of purifying, refining and sublimating
facile impulses and primary needs cannot assert itself, or in which the
stylization of life, i.e., the primacy of form over function, which leads to
the denial of function, does not produce the same effects. p.177

>Tastes in food also depend on the idea each class has of the body and of
the effects of food on the body, that is, on its strength, health and beauty;
and on the categories it uses to evaluate these effects, some of which may
be important for one class and ignored by another, and which the different
classes may rank in very different ways. Thus, whereas the working
classes are more attentive to the strength of the ( male) body than its
shape, and tend to go for products that are both cheap and nutritious,
the professions prefer products that are tasty, heal th-giving, ligh t and not
fattening. Taste, a class culture turned into nature, that is, embodied, helps
to shape the class body. It is an incorporated principle of classification
which governs all forms of incorporation, choosing and modifying
everything that the body ingests and digests and assimilates, physiologically
and psychologically. I t follows that the body is the most indisputable
materialization of class taste, which it manifests in several ways. It
does this first in the seemingly most natural features of the body, the dimensions
( volume, heigh t, weigh t) and shapes ( round or square, stiff or
supple, straight or curved ) of its visible forms, which express in countless
ways a whole relation to the body, i.e., a way of treating it, caring for it,
feeding i t, maintaining it, which reveals the deepest dispositions of the
habitus. p.190

*The biggest question we have to ask is - are all practices imbued with meaning necessarily? Do we need to show that the way we do x translates onto some economic/social criteria. It seems possible that this is true, and also that it is not necessarily true.*

>On Sundays, while the women are on their
feet, busily serving, clearing the table, washing up, the men remain
seated, still eating and drinking. These strongly marked differences of social
status ( associated with sex and age ) are accompanied by no practical
differen tiation ( such as the bourgeois division between the dining room
and the kitchen, where the servants eat and sometimes the children ) , and
strict sequencing of the meal tends to be ignored. Every thing may be put
on the table at much the same time ( wh ich also saves walking ) , so that
the women may have reached the dessert, and also the children, who will
take their plates and watch television, while the men are still eating the
main dish and the 'lad', who has arrived late, is swallowing his soup. p.195


>Fully to construct
the space of l i fe-styles within which cultural practices are defined,
one would first h ave to establish, for each class and class fraction, that is,
for each of the configurations of capital, the generative formula of the
habitus which retranslates the necessi ties and facili ties characteristic of
that class of ( relatively ) homogeneous condi tions of existence into a particular
life-style. One would then have to determine how the disposi tions
of the habitus are specified, for each of the major areas of practice, by implementing
one of the stylistic possibles offered by each field ( the field of
sport, or m usic, or food, decoration, poli tics, language etc. ) . By superimposing
these homologous spaces one would obtain a rigorous represen tation
of the space of life-styles, making it possible to characterize each of
the distinctive features ( e.g., wearing a cap or playing the piano ) in the
two respects in which it is objectively defined, that is, on the one hand by
reference to the set of features constituting the area in question (e.g., the
system of hairstyles ) , and on the other hand by reference to the set of
features constituting a particular life-style ( e.g., the working-class lifestyle
) , within which its social significance is determined. p.209

## Dynamics of the Fields
Fields produce not only through supply and demand...but based on the tastes and the complicated relationship they have to production.

>Those whom we find to our taste put into their practices a taste which
does not differ from the taste we put into operation in perceiving their
practices. Two people can give each other no better proof of the affinity
of their tastes than the taste they have for each other. p.243

THere are also symbolic struggles?

..skipping to conclusion..
>Dispositions are adjusted not only to a class condition, presenting itself
as a set of possibilities and impossibilities, but also to a relational l y defined
position, a rank in the class structure. They are therefore always related,
objectively at least, to the dispositions associated with other
positions. This means that, being 'adapted' to a particular class of conditions
of existence characterized by a particular degree of distance from necessity,
class 'moralities' and 'aesthetics' are also necessarily situated with
respect to one another by the criterion of degree of banality or distinction,
and that all the 'choices' they produce are automatically associated
with a distinct position and therefore endowed with a distinctive value. p.246

# Conclusion

>The schemes of the habitus, the primary forms of classification,
owe their specific efficacy to the fact that they function below the level of
consciousness and language, beyond the reach of introspective scrutiny
or control by the will . p.466


>This means, in the first place, that social science, in constructing the social
world, takes note of the fact that agents are, in their ordinary practice,
the subjects of acts of construction of the social world; but also that
it aims, among other things, to describe the social genesis of the principles
of construction and seeks the basis of these principles in the social
world.3 p.468

>The cognitive structures which social agents implement in their practical
knowledge of the social world are internalized, 'embodied' social
structures. The practical knowledge of the social world that is presupposed
by 'reasonable' behaviour within it implements classificatory
schemes (or 'forms of classification', 'mental structures' or 'symbolic
forms'--apart from their connotations, these expressions are virtually interchangeable
) , historical schemes of perception and appreciation which
are the product of the objective division into classes ( age groups,
genders, social classes) and which function below the level of consciousness
and discourse. p.468

>The practical mastery of classification has nothing in common with
the reflexive mastery that is required in order to construct a taxonomy
that is simultaneously coherent and adequate to social reality. The practical
'science' of positions in social space is the competence presupposed by
the art of behaving comme il [aut w i th persons and things that h ave and
give 'class' ( 'smart' or 'unsmart' ) , finding the righ t distance, by a sort of
practical calculation p.472

That is, the practical action and the intellectual operations are separate from one another.

>There i s n o better image o f the logic o f socialization, which treats the
body as a 'memory-jogger', than those complexes of gestures, postures
and words-simple in terjections or favouri te cliches-which only have to
be slipped into, like a theatrical costume, to awaken, by the evocative
power of bodily mimesis, a universe of ready-made feelings and experiences. p. 474

>What is at stake in the struggles about the meaning of the social world is
power over the classificatory schemes and systems which are the basis of
the representations of the groups and therefore of their mobilization and
demobilization: the evocative power of an utterance which puts things in
a different light ( as happens, for example, when a single word, such as
'paternalism', changes the whole experience of a social relationship ) or
which modifies the schemes of perception, shows something else, other
properties, previously unnoticed or relegated to the background ( such as
common interests hitherto masked by ethnic or national differences) ; a
separative power, a distinction, diacrisis, discretio, drawing discrete units
out o f indivisible continuity , difference o u t of the undifferentiat p.479

>Systems of classification would not be such a decisive object of struggle
if they did not contribute to the existence of classes by enhancing the efficacy
of the objective mechanisms with the reinforcement supplied by
representations structured in accordance with the classification. The imposition
of a recognized name is an act of recognition of full social existence
which transmutes the thing named. It no longer exists merely de
facto, as a tolerated, illegal or illegitimate practice, but becomes a social
function, i.e., a mandate, a mission ( Eeruf ) , a task, a role-all words
which express the difference between authorized activity, which is assigned
to an individual or group by tacit or explicit delegation, and mere
usurpation, which creates a 'state of affairs' awaiting institutionalization . p.480

But social subjects alsocomprehend the world around them - so...
>What we have to do is to bring into the science of scarcity,
and of competition for scarce goods, the practical knowledge which the
agents obtain for themselves by producing--on the basis of their experience
of the distributions, itself dependent on their position in the distributions--d
ivisions and classifications which are no less objective than
those of the balance-sheets of social physics. p.483
