 Eventually you'll have 4 or 5 questions that you can remind me of and we can have a question here where she could say "I know from talking to you that you're interested in looking at a way to rehabilitate the concept of values. Can you lay out the concepts that are related or not related. What would a model like be?"



I guess the question is, I see in Parsons/Schutz/Berger and Luckmann a focus on many of the same concepts, that is, shared knowledge, an individual's particular course of actions and an understanding of the motivations/justifications.


How would you try to incorporate both ideas on action that focus on how individuals take on specific practices that are perhaps unrelated, and


It seems like there is a confusing set of possibilities when looking at any action. The action could be spurred out of some internal value and it's apparent on its face. The action could be directed by a certain value and it's not apparent, in that it seems random, the logic of the act is inconsistent with what we would expect, or the actor wants to make it seem like they are operating on one value when they are operating on another.

The action could be relatively unconsidered, picked up by others unthinkingly. One might act unthinkingly and upon reflection attempt to make sense of their own actions with respect to their own value systems.
