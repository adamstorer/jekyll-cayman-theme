Abstract: "Although the 1960 student sit-ins were not nearly as uncoordinated as contemporaneous and subsequent accounts suggested, their repeated characterization in participants' accounts as "spontaneous" merits explana- tion. Analysis of campus newspaper articles and letters to the editor, speeches, and organizational and personal correspondence shows the emergence of a coherent and compelling narrative of the sit-ins, in which spontaneity denoted not a lack of prior coordination but independence from adult leadership, urgency, local initiative, and action by moral imperative rather than bureaucratic planning. Narratives of the sit-ins, told by many tellers, in more and less public settings, and in which spontaneity was a central theme, helped to constitute "student activ- ist" as a new collective identity and to make high risk activism attractive. It was the storied character of represen- tations of the sit-ins that compelled participation. This case suggests the more general importance of narrative- as distinct from collective action "frames" in accounting for mobilization that takes place before the consolida- tion of movement organizations."

Abstract:
>Although the 1960 student sit-ins were not nearly as uncoordinated as contemporaneous and subsequent accounts suggested, their repeated characterization in participants' accounts as "spontaneous" merits explana- tion. Analysis of campus newspaper articles and letters to the editor, speeches, and organizational and personal correspondence shows the emergence of a coherent and compelling narrative of the sit-ins, in which spontaneity denoted not a lack of prior coordination but independence from adult leadership, urgency, local initiative, and action by moral imperative rather than bureaucratic planning. Narratives of the sit-ins, told by many tellers, in more and less public settings, and in which spontaneity was a central theme, helped to constitute "student activ- ist" as a new collective identity and to make high risk activism attractive. It was the storied character of represen- tations of the sit-ins that compelled participation. This case suggests the more general importance of narrative- as distinct from collective action "frames" in accounting for mobilization that takes place before the consolida- tion of movement organizations.

Sociologists thought that there was some kind of sudden decision to do the sit ins but really it was an orgnaized effort. They emphasize the absence of planning. The stories that Poletta looks at shows the distinction between spontaneous and unplanned.

The narrative form may be used to frame issues in a certain way?

Framing is thought of as the persuasive efforts of already establishe movement organizations. But framing can also hlept to form something,

>We still know little about how the interpretive processes occurring in oppositional subcultures and indigenous institutions, and occurring during initial episodes of collective action (strikes, marches, occupations, etc.) yield movement identities on behalf of which people are willing to sacrifice their personal welfare p.138

What is the role of the narrative? It is a prominent process because it can use the past present and future to align collective action. Narratives allow for some ambiguity in the collective action? I am not sure I'm convinced in this case. A certain narrative, in the right place, can do framing in a way separate from a frame.

## Frames

How do you get people to participate in your protest? Frames might do it by giving people some schema to make sense of what's going on.
>Frames combine a diagnosis of the social condition in need of remedy, a prognosis for how to do that, and a rationale for action. p.139

Certain thigns make frames more or less succesful around certain people. I think a lot of discussion around frames isnt really fully theorized.

Some people think narratives can be used as a discursive form in which a frame is expressed.

## HOw are narratives different from frames?

1. narratives configuration of events over time makes them important to the construction and maintenance of individual or group identities.
2. Frames make everything clear, stories leave some points up to the imagination.   
>Contrary, then, to Benford's contention that a successful agency, it seems that this story was successful precisely by its failure to supply a logical explanation for action. It promises to explain the link between action places us, the reader/listener, at the victorious end. Penetrating the mystery of collective action requires more stories, and indeed, requires not only stories

3. Narratives deal with the polyvalence of meaning in ways that frames don't.

Moreover, the spread of a frame, the diffusion of it, makes much more sense as teh telling of a story.
This is a really wonky argument.

While framing theorists argue that a frame makes actions more clear, we see that often times people's accounts of what happened was ambivalent. In describing the sit-ins, whether the act had a conscious intent, whether it was planned or not, was up for grabs. Students described it as spontaneous.

The problem is, right, that the organizations that planned these things wanted to make it seem spontaneous. And so the stories in newspapers are up for grabs in terms of whether they are part of a "frame" or not.

I guess it really is a question of the role of frames and stories, because we have a pretty clear venn diagram. Sometimes they are together and sometimes they are separate. But are there any frames that do not have stories attributed to them? Just dry accounts or linked value systems? Narratives are the ways in which frames are communicated, are they not?

Stories told of spontaneity and helped to create the group student activist, which bridged the gap between adults planning the protests and individual's acting on their own in playing it out.

Not taking responsibility, allowing for things to be spontaneous, means that there is some idea of just  having too much, of the lack of freedom and inequality becoming so much that some group show of support just happens out of nowhere. Spontaneity also makes it seem like you could be just as much a protester as anyone else. But this is aprt of it.

>Rather than simply persuasive devices deployed by strategic collective actors, narratives help to constitute new strategic actors.

This is maybe an overstatement of ways to manipulate people into joining your cause.
