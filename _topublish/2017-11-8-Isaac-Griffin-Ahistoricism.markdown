title:  "Isaac and Griffin - Ahistoricism in Time-Series Analyses of Historical Process"

published: true
Abstract: "Most time-ordered analyses of historical processes are rendered "ahistorical" because the premises that direct quantitative inquiry obscure changing historical relations through time. These conventional practices stem from three problematic presuppositions: (1) the separation of theory and history, (2) ahistorical conceptions of time, and (3) methodological autonomy and the primacy of the theory of statistical technique. We illustrate how these premises shape sociological-historical investigation by examining several quantitative historical analyses of labor organization and conflict. Reanalysis of the same historical series with temporally moving covariance analysis demonstrates theoretically important historical contingency as well as the error of presupposing temporal homogeneity in historical relationships. Our critique of conventional practice and our reanalysis enable us to pose alternative premises to ground quantitative historical research in the interdependence
of history and theory, in historical conceptions of time, and in the historicization of quantitative methodology. Our redirection aims at moving us closer to historical actuality, that is, to historical relations and processes, when we use time-series data and analytic procedures."

The argument here, right is that when using regression techniques you still need to historicize macro-level processes. Many times we do not.

## Conventional premises and Historical Time-Series Analysis

### Separation of Theory and HIstory
This stance is that social theory is relatively ahistorical and must separate itself from history. Here there are two implicit assumptions
1. Theory is uncontaminated by history  
2. History is not distorted or mediated by theory.

For instance, Hannan and Freeman try to use pop ecology to make an argument about union foundings. Here history is "reduced to data" for testing an elaboration of a theory.

## Ahistorical Time
>This practice constructs "time" to be a linear organizing device for a sequence of events or an incremental counter "marking time" in equal units as in clock or calendar time. p.875

To be honest I am not sure what the argument is here, and I think to some extent it is the argument that you see ina lot of this stuff.

### Methodological Autonomy
Statistical significance is more important than anything. This means you might need more observations that span distinctive eras in US history, and then you end up trying to draw conclusions from this weird data set because you need your signficance.


# Redoing Analysis of Union Strikes

The idea here is to redo the analysis with something called "moving regressions" or regressions in which the window of data is limited.
What you find is that getting rid of the year 1937 changes all sorts of things because important things in labor history happen during this period.

They then try to reconstruct premises for a more historical version of quantitative historical work. This essentially means thinking about how things might change your data in certain ways and taking account for it, largely in the ways you do your analysis rather than in the variables you control for.
