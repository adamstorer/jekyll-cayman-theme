People have moved away from the factory - but Burawoy shows how conflict or consent is constructed on the shop floor. Organization theory seems to assume harmony and social control, but if there is harmony, why is social control important?

That is, we still must understand how conflict functions in an organization.

People do not think deeply enough about the ways in which organizations use social control to deal with conflict. Those that do produce typologies without producing explanations.

# Toward a Theory of the Capitalist Labor Process

Sociology takes capitalist society as universal.

For Burawoy, lived experience is the center of ideology:
>institutions elaborate and systematize lived experience and only in this way become centers of ideological dissemination. p. 17

To understand interests, we have to understand the spontaneous consciousness of social relations.

Maybe marx ignored consent because wage and effort used to be tied so tightly together, but now to produceeffort you really need to produce consent - and this is necessary to realize surplus value.

And this suprlus value must be realizzed in a way that is invisible to the laborers.

>By examining changes in the labor process at one particualr factory over a period of thirty years I hope to illuminate teh mechanisms of organizing consent on the shop floor, of constituting workers as individuals rather than members of a class, of coordinating the interests of labor and capital as well as those of workers and managers, and of redistributing conflict and competition.  p.30

# Geer Company to Allied Corporation

At Geer Company Roy found that people were treated poorly, and he wanted to understand why people work as hard as they do.

The payment rate changed
1945 - Straight piece rate systemm, no extra benefits, a price rather than a rate for each thing. Earnings tied to experience and less to apricular types of jobs.
1970 - Base earnings (times percent rate up to 125% plus shift differentials and rate for each thing)

In the more current system, one had to figure out how much it made sense to work - in the previous system one was always incentivized to work ahrder.

1945 - Increase payments by fighitng for higher day rates, or increase prices for something. This meant being put on different jobs often for individuals
1975 - Bargaining took place witha dminsitrative management.

Makign out is a game workers play in the 1970's which is focused on trying to get paid as much as possible for working as little as possible.

But really, in attempting to make out under a game where it is built into the system that in certain situations you can "pull one over" on the boss, the organization creates consent to the production of surplus value, production at a much higher level.

A game stops working when:
1. Uncertainty is too gret and outcomes are beyond contrul
2. Uncertainty is too slight and outcomes are completley controlled by players
3. When players are indifferent ot the outcomes.

  There is also a somewhat antiquated argument about the way in which the internal labor market obscures surplus value by internalizing competitive free and equal laborers. The mobility is also (like edwards) something which dissolves tensions between workers and management and generates tension between workers. IN this way, the workers interests are individualized.

  ## Chapter 9

  While Marxists usually think about orientations to work as part of some overall notion of identity, industrial sociologists rarely go outside the single notion.

  Burawoy asks of surveys on workers (Which Goldthorpe et. al provide):
  >When they are divorced from their context, how can one interpret the enumeration of a set of attitudes? To what reality do these attitudes refer? They appear to reflect a general attitutde twoard work in capitalist society, to a reluctance to engage in meaningless, boring, and coercive routines. p. 138

  There are definitely cliques based on outside characteristics (race, gender, age religioin,common interests) but the companies hope to force a worker to see themselves as an individual, not part of a group.

  Burawoy argues that the attitudes did not match with the behavior. And in fact, other aspects of the job lead coworkers to rely on one anoher regardless of their race.

  That is, in some ways outside differences became a tool one could draw upon in order to comment upon power differentials or job based difficulties.

  Burawoy's model is one of RELAtIVE AUTONOMY - that is -
  >the labor process may itself determine the effect of imported consciousness.
