HPV causes cervical vaccines and in places where the vaccine is taken there is way less cervical cancer.

How was this possible?

Innovation is the encapsulation of meaning across networks?

Theere is also a normative program which thinks of scientific innovation as the evolution of norms and systems of credit.

Most of these focus on the relationship between industry and academia. While they presuppose that market logic is dominant, it's a little more confusing. We have to look more closely at the role of state actors. This vaccine was invtented and patented by the Federal Gov. And the gederal government often does some of the innovation.

How did past intiatives in the government allow for further innovation. We get 30k administrative and archival documents.

Studies focus on the National Cancer Institute, and is often very good at innovation.


Is innovation social learning? The acquisition of knowledge and transmission.

These people see learning as outcome and we can also look at learning as process.

Learning as devleopment of competencies  

how do actors goals emerge as "ends in view"

Physicality/"Materialist" take on learning

To me this feels like a systematic over-complication of concepts that are fairly simple. A bunch of neologisms stuck together to say something that people could easily intuit in a way that is incomprehensible to a general (or even a semi-specialized) audience.

There is an Event - Iteration - Innovation
There is Colligation - Encoding - Competencies
There are ends in view - routines - organization

There as a push to increase the connection between bench and bedside researchers/thinkers.


Is this a case of a new type of learning or a failure of the basic system of this type of scientific research?
