Abstract: "We develop and test predictions on how early career challenges arising from the workplace context affect short- and long-term career advancement of individuals. Typically an organization’s decision to deploy a manager to one of several possible contexts is endogenous to unobservable factors, and selection makes it challenging to disentangle the effect of workplace context on individual career advancement. We work around this problem by studying an organization, the Indian Administrative Services, which deploys entry-level managers quasirandomly across India. We find that managers deployed to more challenging contexts early in their careers experience faster career advancement in the short term. We present suggestive evidence that this is because challenging contexts provide managers more opportunities to develop skills (“crucible experiences”), and a greater motivation to relocate out of the challenging context. We also find that managers deployed to a challenging context early in their careers continue to experience faster advancement in the long term, suggesting that initial deployment to a challenging context is associated with human capital development. Managers initially deployed to more challenging contexts were not, however, more likely to break into the upper echelons of the organization."

Abstract
>We develop and test predictions on how early career challenges arising from the workplace context affect short- and long-term career advancement of individuals. Typically an organization’s decision to deploy a manager to one of several possible contexts is endogenous to unobservable factors, and selection makes it challenging to disentangle the effect of workplace context on individual career advancement. We work around this problem by studying an organization, the Indian Administrative Services, which deploys entry-level managers quasirandomly across India. We find that managers deployed to more challenging contexts early in their careers experience faster career advancement in the short term. We present suggestive evidence that this is because challenging contexts provide managers more opportunities to develop skills (“crucible experiences”), and a greater motivation to relocate out of the challenging context. We also find that managers deployed to a challenging context early in their careers continue to experience faster advancement in the long term, suggesting that initial deployment to a challenging context is associated with human capital development. Managers initially deployed to more challenging contexts were not, however, more likely to break into the upper echelons of the organization.

Here we are thinking about career advancement, and the way that early experiences effect it.

>We hypothesize that individuals in more challenging
contexts will experience faster short-term career
advancement than those in less challenging contexts.
We theorize that there are two mechanisms behind
this: opportunities to develop skills and the motivation
to relocate out of the challenging context p.211

They study this at an Indian administrative unit where managers are sent out semi-randomly. ]

As managers are sent out, they have to do things that ar emore or less challening.

Challenging jobs have high levels of uncertainty and threats arising from external adversity.

Challenges, again, create greater opportunities to develop skills, and also incentivize people to move on.

These both lead to hypotheses:
1. Individuals with difficult early experiences will be promoted in the short term.
2. Individuals will experience faster career advancement
3. Individuals will experience more career advancement


This second one is a little more complex, the argument is that there is more of a development of skills (human-capital development) early on, and this benefits a person down the line.

>1964). Early career individuals are more
susceptible to environmental influence (Marquis and
Tilcsik 2013) and to learning new skills, work routines,
and practices, and these influences persist through
their careers. Early professional training influences
individuals’ norms and habits (Bercovitz and Feldman
2008) and their likelihood of adopting certain types
of organizational practices; early social networks and
socialization also influence subsequent career decisions
(McEvily et al. 2012, Phillips 2005)... We draw on this wellestablished
literature to hypothesize that early career
deployment to challenging contexts will have positive
persistent effects on speed of subsequent career
advancement via human-capital development. p.213

Ultimately, the idea is not only that they move up faster, but they move higher.

And essentially they look at the indian civil service, which is a group of managers of managers.
