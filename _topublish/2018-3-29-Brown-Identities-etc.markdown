Abstract: "This paper analyses how people’s subjectively construed identities are disciplined by, and appropriated from, their talk about organizational routines. Identity work, we argue, is not just an expression of agency but also of power. Based on a study of a UK regional law firm, our research counter-balances understandings of professional lawyers as autonomous knowledge-workers, and emphasizes instead the extent of their subjection to disciplinary processes. It shows that power is intrinsic to discursive constructions of routine processes of organizing. We examine lawyers’ accounts of their time-keeping and billing routine, and how these both fabricated their identities, and how individuals said that they confronted, shifted and perverted organizationally sanctioned systems of meaning. The research contribution of this paper is to examine empirically and to theorize how discourse about routines both disciplines and is a resource for identity work."

>This paper analyses how people’s subjectively construed identities are disciplined by, and appropriated from, their talk about organizational routines. Identity work, we argue, is not just an expression of agency but also of power. Based on a study of a UK regional law firm, our research counter-balances understandings of professional lawyers as autonomous knowledge-workers, and emphasizes instead the extent of their subjection to disciplinary processes. It shows that power is intrinsic to discursive constructions of routine processes of organizing. We examine lawyers’ accounts of their time-keeping and billing routine, and how these both fabricated their identities, and how individuals said that they confronted, shifted and perverted organizationally sanctioned systems of meaning. The research contribution of this paper is to examine empirically and to theorize how discourse about routines both disciplines and is a resource for identity work.

>The key argument we elaborate is that lawyers’ identities were disciplined by and appropriated from talk about their time reckoning and client billing routine. This is noteworthy in part because considerably less attention has been given to organizational design and the power embedded in overall authoritative structure than to deviations from this order (Brown et al. 2010; Hardy and Clegg 1996). By analysing lawyers’ descriptions of routine patterns of work we seek to understand how they constituted, expressed and affirmed conceptions of their selves as productive lawyers p.872

## Identity

We are focused on subjectively construed identity, organized reflexive narratives.

They are constructed within discursive regimes - Read and Bartowski 2000.

People do some work at this level in forming or revising the sense of identity in order to produce a sense of coherence.

People update these identities.

>The picture of lawyers that emerges from this research is of a group that subscribes to a view of their selves as ‘guardians’ of societal ethics and ‘trustees’ of professional expertise, but also experts offering specialist knowledge to competitive client markets p.873

People talk about lawyers subjetively conceived identities - and there are thought to be different types.

But how are they effects of power? Or routines?

## Power

>we analyse routine activities as techniques which aim to transform notionally autonomous professionals into corporate duplicates of the organization (cf. Starkey and McKinlay 1998; Townley 1993). p.873

WE have to think about how disciplinary technologies function

This paper considers billing practices specifically - and understanding the ways in which this effects how people build their identities.

>More than this, as Foucault suggests in his later work, it is through frameworks of discipline and self-knowledge that individuals create their selves as aesthetic projects: discipline is thus the necessary price that we pay for realizing desire p.874

## Routines

Routines are recognizable patterns - which have important elmen4ets of mindfulness underneath them.

>The ways that routines are implicated in relations of power has only prompted limited interest. Nevertheless, there is an established literature which analyses how routines may be sources of accountability and political protection (Weber 1947; Crozier 1964). Braverman (1974) and Burawoy (1979) have theorized routines as means by which managerial controls may be exerted over a labour force and conflict suppressed. Other theorists suggest that routines promote perceptions of legitimacy for organizations by encouraging behaviours that conform to social norms (Feldman and March 1981; Meyer and Rowan 1977). p.875

>Drawing on these literatures, we analyse how lawyers’ identities were disciplined by (and appropriated from) discourses centred on routine time reckoning and billing. We show that identity work is not merely an expression of agency but is also an effect of power. Thus are the subjectively construed identities of individuals and organizations caught in ongoing discursive struggles for ‘closure’. p.875

This is all to say that the routines surrounding billing constitute a discipline/have the power to shape peoples subjective identities of themselves. More below!

To study this he conducts 55 minute interviews with 40 different people.

They tried to ask non-leading questions about productivity and autonomy.

They did a bottom up coding, and talked about how their job was routinized:


>If you phoned me in my office, I would receive your call by immediately opening up a time clock and that clock will start running as soon as we start speaking or as soon as I get it running. And then, after our conversation and I’d completed whatever instruction you’ve given me, then the clock would stop and I’d post it, complete that clock and move onto the next job. And at the end of the day it’s all added up. p.878

Lawyers msut be very intense in their recording of time. People become quite concerned about recording their times.

Some said that even if you were pooping and thinking about something, you should write it down.

>People recognized that being seen not to record time effectively ‘will impact on your promotional prospects’ (Associate Solicitor #1). At LF, routine accounting for time and its negotiation were talking points through which lawyers verbalized thoughts, feelings and intentions about their selves so as to better know and change their selves and others 879

They argue the billing routine is a "normalizing technique that subjugated lawyers by rendering them subject to processes of comparison and correction, and as such was equivalent to other recognized disciplinary techniques such as dress cdes and time tables. It was a means of measuring labour and binding them to a system with which they came to define their organizational reality and their own identities" p.880

>The system of time/billing may also be theorized as a technology of the self, a form of action by which people were urged to talk about themselves, by which subjects came to be tied to their identity. For junior staff, knowing that promotion was in part dependent on particular kinds of routine action rendered continuously salient the apparent need to conform. It served to infuse individuals with the norms and values of their organization, and led them to exert self-discipline within coordinates imposed by the firm. p..880

Routines, the billing technqiues served to make individual and organizational objectives consonant.

They also weren't mindless, people thought quite a bit about the right amount to bill. Ther'es also a lot about impression management tied to billing.

When they talk about use of the system, they talked about their own and other identities.

>The picture that emerges is of lawyers seeking to establish and protect professional identities as institutionally productive but self-reflexive and quasi-autonomous individuals. This appropriation of discourses centred on timing/billing was a form of identity work used to secure a stable sense of self (Knights and McCabe 2000; Willmott 1994). Lawyers’ engagement with the organizational routine was also simultaneously an interrogation – often mindful and rarely unproblematic – in which the objectives of the firm were just one factor that impinged on their achievement of them. p.884

This isnot really worker resistance, but more an individualized approrpiation of discursive resources for thier own purposes.

>Lawyers’ talk about their performance of the time/billing routine constituted the extent to which they were not wholly colonized by power/knowledge but able to liberate themselves from normalizing and totalizing tendencies of local discourses. Their articulations of the flexible and varied performances of the routine reflected their capacity for individual agency, their ability to selectively recognize, locate and implement routines ‘in their ongoing and situated transactions’ p.885
