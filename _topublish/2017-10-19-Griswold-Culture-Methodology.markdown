>Drawing on analytic techniques from the humanities and social sciences, propose a framework for research in the sociology of culture that scientific and sensitive to the particular characteristics of cultural this paper, I maintain that to be complete and persuasive, analysis must include (1) the intentions of creative agents, (2) the reception of cultural objects over time and space, (3) the comprehension of cultural objects in terms of intrinsic and heuristic genres, and (4) the explanation of the characteristics of objects with reference to the social and cultural experiences framework based on criteria of parsimony, competing explanations framework and validity to a puzzle regarding the changes a Western popular fiction genre underwent when it was reproduced in Nigeria.

Griswold argues that current versions of culture research are on two poles, which are equally problematic.
>dThis division of labor, between those who offer subtle yet ungeneralizable interpretations of cultural phenomena and those who reduce cultural phenomena to univocal indicators of social institutions, has created a social science of culture that is either inattentive to science or insensitive to culture

Griswold believes there is a possibility to make headway in the sociology of culture. This begins with the cultural object.
<def>cultural object: shared significance embodied in form, an expression of social meanings that is tangible or can be put into words.</def>

With the object in mind, one must understand the follwoing:
<def>How does one analyze a cultural object?: Understand its intention, reception, comprehension and explanation</def>

The one that is a little confusing is comprehension, which Griswold defines below:
>Comprehension is the analyst's consideration of the internal structures, patterns, and symbolic carrying capacities of the cultural objects. Genre is the key here,

Griswold then goes on to understand each of these four in detail, studying Baxendall's study of Piero della Francesca, the painting of "Baptism of Christ"

TO me this is fine but not particularly useful because it is unclear how operating at the methodological level will allow individuals to converge along conceptual lines. But I suppose this is really just taking 4 concepts to the foreground, so it's not really all that distinct.

But remember, anything can be a cultural object, it becomes such by the gaze of the analyst.To comprehend the object, you understand the symbols, patterns of symbols and formal structure.


What about validity? An inference is valid if it connects two or more elements and the connection is a correct one based on evidence and if it meets the standards of social science.
