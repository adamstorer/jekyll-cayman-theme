title:  "Gieryn - Boundary-Work and the Demarcation of Science from Non-Science"

Abstract: "The demarcation of science from other intellectual activities-long an analytic problem for philosophers and sociologists-is here examined as a practical problem for scientists. Construction of a boundary between science and varieties of non-science is useful for scientists' pursuit of professional goals: acquisition of intellectual authority and career opportunities; denial of these resources to pseudoscientists; and protection of the autonomy of scientific research from political interference. Boundary-work describes an ideological style found in scientists' attempts to create a public image for science by contrasting it favorably to non-scientific intellectual or technical activities. Alternative sets of characteristics available for ideological attribution to science reflect ambivalences or strains within the institution: science can be made to look empirical or theoretical, pure or applied. However, selection of one or another description depends on which characteristics best achieve the demarcation in a way that justifies scientists' claims to authority or resources. Thus, "science" is no single thing: its boundaries are drawn and redrawn inflexible, historically changing and sometimes ambiguous ways"

>The demarcation of science from other intellectual activities-long an analytic problem for philosophers and sociologists-is here examined as a practical problem for scientists. Construction of a boundary between science and varieties of non-science is useful for scientists' pursuit of professional goals: acquisition of intellectual authority and career opportunities; denial of these resources to "pseudoscientists"; and protection of the autonomy of scientific research from political interference. "Boundary-work" describes an ideological style found in scientists' attempts to create a public image for science by contrasting it favorably to non-scientific intellectual or technical activities. Alternative sets of characteristics available for ideological attribution to science reflect ambivalences or strains within the institution: science can be made to look empirical or theoretical, pure or applied. However, selection of one or another description depends on which characteristics best achieve the demarcation in a way that justifies scientists' claims to authority or resources. Thus, "science" is no single thing: its boundaries are drawn and redrawn inflexible, historically changing and sometimes ambiguous ways.

## Introduction

What is science? Popper argues that you need to be making falsifiable claims to be doing science, but Popper and other explanations don't match up with waht we think about as science or non-science.

There are really problems of demarcation that are unsolved, that are tied to resources and legitimacy.  Scientists do boundary-work to post-hoc differntiate themselves from others, and by trying to show that there is non-science. Professional ideologies of science have distinctive styles and content.

## Sociological Theories of Ideology
<def>Parsons versions of ideology: Strain theory. Ideologies provide a way integrate conflicting demands/competing expectations in an ambivalent social world. Ideologies are symptoms as well as symbolic reovluions of role strain. </def>
<def>Marx/Mannheim version of ideology: Interest theory. Ideologies are social lever or weapons used by groups to further their political or economicinterestes amidst universal struggles for power and advantage. Manipulations of ideas to persuade people to think and act in ways benefiting the ideologist. </def>

Both theories have symbolic representations, both suggest that ideologies selectively distort reality, and both assume that adequate explanation requires examination of the context around ideological statements.

Geertz clarifies the theories by allowing them to be combined. He also argues stylistic resources can be used to make sense of how ideologists group things together.
<def>Two gaps in ideological theory identified by Geertz: 1. If strains and interests affect ideology, one needs a theory to articulate the interaction between these two things.  2. What causes stylistic variation in the rhetoric of ideologists.

## Science

People are not sure what the relationship between science and ideology is. It is rarely asked how science acquires intellectual authority.

People basically had to give science it's intellectual authority, and work went into doing it. What kind of work, boundary work? And that work fits in with ideologies. To make science a thing, they basically had tofight ideological warfare/do boundary work to usurp authority over the meaning of the natural world from religious leaders.

Because of the specifics of the situation, science was sometimes contrasted with science. They also had to separate science from mechanics, and this contrastic point was somewhat different than others.

## Phrenologists and Atomists

Science was not only made a discipline through ideology, but some scientists were discredited over others as part of ideology.

## National Security

Scientists must also make claims for resources. One must retain control over resources and autonomy.

# Conclusion

Ideologies need foils, ideology plays a clear role in boundary work. When would one see boundary work to be a resource for a profession?

1. When the goal is expansion over other domains.
2. When the goal is monopolization of professional authority over pseudo's or amateurs.
3. When the goal is protection of autonomy over professional activity.


I guess the question is, where do the goals come from? How do you identify the truth from the use of knowledge?
