Sociology has two types of action, rational and normatively oriented. But Joas argues that we are always acting creatively.

# The Emergence of the Theory of Action

Really it comes from parsons.
>Parsons puts forward
his own solution to the problems he has discussed in the form of a
voluntaristic theory of action and, closely bound up with this, a normativist
theory of social order. p.8

>To Parsons' mind
the dilemma utilitarianism faces thus consists of it having either to
assume that free will exists and therefore to assert that goals vary at
random, or conversely to assume that goals do not vary at random, at
the cost of no longer being able to find a place for free choice and
individual decisions in its conceptual framework p.11

Parsons was against utilitarians and empiricists. Parsons wanted scientific progress to have a conceptual frame of reference.

>The concept of analytical realism is meant to show that although
the goal is still to provide an explanation of reality, this can be
achieved only by isolating specific analytical elements; instead of
'reifying' them, that is, falsely equating them with traits of reality, the
task - as Parsons saw it - was to arrive at a systematic appraisal of
these analytical elements p.14

So waht is parsons alternative to utilitarianism completely rational action?
>His alternative consists
in assuming that social order is guaranteed by mutually formed
values and in maintaining that the model of rational action can be
overcome by considering those nonnative orientations which are
involved in the constitution of goals and the choice of means. If social
order is to signify more than the mere factual order of an aggregation
of actions and more than the temporary stabilization of competition
for resources and power, then this presumes that all actors share
common orientations that are not subject to the individual actor's
subjective calculations of utility, but, on the contrary, are what make
individual calculations of utility possible in the first place p.14

Parsons includes a means-ends line of thought, and from idealists he talks about how ultimate values are the basis for means. He also hoped to have some kind of notion of "effort" and drew pon it a little from Freud.

## Objections to Parsons

The biggest one comes from Simmel, who was left out becase it didn't fit. That is, Simmel was concerend with the relations between actors, which was different from Parsons. What we see are a number of irrefutable flaws:
1. No good critique of rational action
2. Taking into account social relations and interaction without using normative consensus
3. No notion of action as self expression
4. Unclear how weighting of different things are done.
5. No distinction between egoistic wishes and rational interest.

Jeffrey Alexander tried to redo Parson's convergence thesis (I think reading everything to look for convergence is kind of boring) and others tried to rehistoricize Parsons.

Joas asks to an extent whether teh convergence theory works atall, and end sup skeptical of it. He does so by comparing Weber's theory of charisma with durkheim's theory of religion.

# Metaphors of Creativity

HOw have we thought of creativity? We understand the concept through metaphor. The metaphors we have are:
1. "expression" - the subjective world of the actor
2. production - material objects
3. revolution - we cna reorganize the socila instittions that govern human coexistence.

WE really need to think about the creativity of action...

Expression is hardly ever considered in other models- but is important.

>If we wish to take the wealth of
phenomena of human action seriously, it may after all be necessary to
regard language as a form of expression and not simply reduce
expression to an aspect of language p.76

WIth production, the Marxists are really in their element, but there is a rational element tied to it all. Marx has a theory of action that is open to interpretation by different thinkers. Joas's take is that
>Marx's endeavours
to reinterpret the relationship between human beings and nature on
the basis of modem economic theory in terms of a world view shaped
by Hegel and Feuerbach p.90

For Marx, labor is part of the essence of human beings, it is what makes them human.

>Here Marx links
the idea of self-production and creativity, taken from the philosophy
of mind, with the anthropological thrust of Feuerbach' s thought. Marx
charges the terms 'labour', 'object-related activity' and 'production'
with pathos without truly clarifying the concepts. He insists on
regarding human labour as an object-related activity, and objectrelated
activity in tum as a manifestation of essential human powers
and as 'pro-duction', the bringing forth of something new in the
world. p.91

In a way, then, one act ccreatively and expresses oneself in production, in material things.

>Habermas defends - rightly, in my opinion -
the necessity of strictly distinguishing between action directed
towards objects and that towards fellow-subjects. Equally justified is
his insistence that it is necessary for a social theory to link various
types of action with one another.p.105

With revolution, we also see more Marx, but Arendt brings a discussion of revolution as a creative action most forcefully:
>revolutionary action means acting
in freedom. It can signify both the creation of that freedom and also
action taken under conditions of already created freedom. Consequently,
Arendt is interested not only in the history of the idea of
revolution, but also in the history of the institutions of political
freedom. By drawing on American traditions, Arendt liberates the
idea of revolutionary action from its Marxist one-sidedness and thus
protects it from having overly great positive or negative mythological
importance attached to it as the historical advent of salvation or
disaster. p. 115

### Life

There is a philosophy that is kind of close to pragmatism, which sees creativity in everday action.

>It thus follows that
persons who are unable to express themselves in poetic form appear
as dull, narrow-minded philistines whose forms of expression do not
merit further attention; that persons who do not find self-fulfilment in
the handling and processing of objects must be alienated; and that
persons who do not actively contribute to paving the way for a
revolution can be nothing more than a part of a homogeneous universe
of repression. The concretist tendency to equate a particular type of
action with the term 'creativity' thus leads to the depreciation of other
types of action and encourages the extension of the concrete typological
concept to metaphorical uses that lie beyond the proper limits of
its applicability. The alternative to this undesirable form of conceptualization
is to regard creativity as an analytical dimension of all
human action. p.116

A philosophy of life is one in which there is some content, that is for eveyrone in their everyday life, and biologically in us.
>By merging these
different meanings, the philosophy of life was able to claim that it
offered an intellectual orientation which was at once both a cultural
critique and a guide to individual conduct that was grounded in the
latest scientific developments. The common point of departure for
most of the philosophers of life was a thinker who had received little
attention in his own day but whose posthumous reputation was all
the more spectacular: Arthur Schopenhauer. p.117

>The typical pragmatist schema anchors
doubt in action, which is conceived in terms of a model of periodically
recurring phases. According to this model, all perception of the world
and all action in the world is anchored in an unreflected belief in selfevident
given facts and successful habits. However, this belief, and
the routines of action based upon it, are repeatedly shattered; what
has previously been a habitual, apparently automatic procedure of
action is interrupted. The world reveals itself to have shattered our
unreflected expectations; our habitual actions meet with resistance
from the world and rebound back on us. This is the phase of real
doubt. And the only way out of this phase is a reconstruction of the
interrupted context. p.128

The reconstruction of the context or action is a creative achievement for pragmatists. There is creativity in individuals forming an explanatory hypothesis for what is going on, and how to react to it.

# Situation - Corporeality - Sociality - The Fundamentals of a Theory of the Creativity of Action

The underlying assumption of rational action theory is that there are some actions which are of a higher order than others.

>All theories of action which proceed
from a type of rational action - irrespective of whether they are based
on a narrower or broader, a utilitarian or a normative concept of
rationality - make at least three assumptions. They presuppose firstly
that the actor is capable of purposive action, secondly that he has
control over his own body, and thirdly that he is autonomous vis-avis
his fellow human beings and environment. p147

We have to dig into these assumptions.  In so doing, we really see that action, either rational or normative, relies on a creativity.

## Non-Teleological Intentionality of Action

When weber talks about action with respect to bureaucracy, there is a semi-rationality to it.
>n other words, the rationality of the (bureaucratic) form of organization
lies precisely in its applicability to a variety of different ends. It
is a means for those who are able to determine ends. In theory, of
course, this latter category potentially includes all the members of the
organization. As a rule, however, it is restricted, in Weber's view, to
the entrepreneurs, the rulers, the leaders, that is, to those who are able
to assert their will by issuing orders and instructions that determine
the actions of others p.150

For Dewey-
>Externally determined goals are
excluded from the reflective processes that are intrinsic to action.Instead they are fixed at a level above the processes of action and it is
this which degrades the means of action to the status of pure means.
In Dewey's writings on ethics it becomes clear that his critique of fixed
goals applies not only to external but also to self-imposed compulsion.
Every sacralization of an end as a value per se conceals from the actor
the further consequences of his definition of goals and choice of
means, as though in some miraculous way these would not occur or
could be ignored. p.155

*I suppose I am wondering what the role of habituated action si here. This argument is address on 156*
The idea is that neither routine action nor action permeated with meaning can be accounted for only using a means-ends model.

The idea that people cognize the world in one step and act on it in another separate act is criticized.
>An alternative
understanding of goal-setting is therefore compelled to conceive of
intentionality no longer as a non-corporeal, purely intellectual faculty.
The means-ends schema cannot be overcome until we recognize that
the practical mediacy of the human organism and its situations
precede all conscious goal-setting. A consideration of the concept of
purpose must ineluctably involve taking account of the corporeality
of human action and its creativity. p. 158


Here is the beginning of JOas's own theory:
>According to this view, our perception of the world appears to be
structured by our capacities for, and experiences of, action. Even when
we are not pursuing any immediate intention of action, the world
exists not simply as an external counterpart to our internal self, but in
the form of possible actions. Our perception is directed not towards
the properties of the world as such, but rather towards our being able
to use in practice in the context of our actions that which we perceive.
In our perception of reality, what we experience is not a subjective
tailoring of reality, but reality as such. Given that the fundamental
forms of our capacity for action lie in the intentional movement of our
body in connection with locomotion, object-manipulation and communication,
our world is initially structured according to these dimensions.
We divide the world into categories such as accessible and
inaccessible, familiar and unfamiliar, controllable and uncontrollable,
responsive and unresponsive. If these action-related expectations
inherent in our perception of the world are not met, we do indeed
dissociate ourselves from a part of the world which now surprisingly
transpires to be inaccessible and unfamiliar, uncontrollable or unresponsive,
and accord it the status of an external object. Yet this
external object with which we are confronted is atypical of our ongoing
relationship to reality - it remains embedded in a world which we
access and which is familiar to us by virtue of our capacity for action. p.158-9

There is also a call to Mills' vocabularies of motives. Which is to say - the pre-reflective aspirations etc are something different. In routinizing some activity or some role, one learns to need a certain thing - which is soemthing like a discovery of oneself.

>Human action is therefore characterized not simply by the interplay
of values and impulses, but by the creative concretization of values as
well as the constructive satisfaction of impulses. No creative action
would be possible without the bedrock of pre-reflective aspirations
towards which the reflection on the concretization of values is oriented...This objective is not accomplished simply by advancing
general theses on the role of ends in human action. Rather, we
must direct our attention to the emergence of the capacity to set goals
and thus uncover the preconditions for this essential component of the
creativity of action. p.163

In other words, Joas wants to know what happens when we do goal setting. The idea is that partially what we are doing is separating what is self and what is society. We do this by identifying transitional objects, objects that are not part of our "security blanket" or our understand of our self.
>Thus play, as the elemental form of human
action, instils in human beings the ability to set goals in a creative
way, yet this ability is not a feature of human action that can simply
be taken for granted; it is a merely potential trait that is contingent on
numerous factors for its realization. p.167

## Constitution of the Body Schema

The idea they are working against is that the body can be controlled to do what the mind wants it to do. THis is an implicit assumption.

But we cannot just confine the body to an instrumental role. BUt the body is not always so compliant with this separate thing the mind.

This does not necessarily mean that the body is "instrumentalized" or "enculturated" in certain ways.

>Action
theory must therefore concern itself not only with the emergence of
control of the body but also with the development of abilities to ease
that control, that is, with intentional reductions in the instrurnentalization
of the body. p.169

In a sense there is a passive intentionality - where one intentially releases the body form control. For instance, falling asleep. We cannot actively force ourselves to sleep.

This is a kind of interim phase in problem solving behavior - in solvin ga problem one must act not only actively, but also be open to new types of action that result from pre-reflective intentionality of the body.

The body leaves two things uncalrified - which human biological preconditions must obtain in order for action to be psosible. Also, how the actor develops the ways in which his body is subjectively present for him.

>In other words, what is involved is not a dualism of mind and body,
but two modes of corporeality. 'Man taken as a concrete being is not a
psyche joined to an organism, but the movement to and fro of
existence which at one time allows itself to take corporeal form and at
others moves towards personal acts.'6 p.180

## Primary Sociality
The last assumption is that there is self-interested autonomous individuals. but people often question this individualism. This is partly broken down because people can anticipate the reactions of others around them.

There is a sense in which Durkheim argues that there is something inherently social in the way individuals interact. Rituals provide such a function in reintegrating the individual with the group and that's why you see people.

# Creative Democracy
>Three arguments have been put forward to explain why a reconstructive
introduction of the tacit assumptions found in the various models
of rational action is necessary.1 Firstly, such an approach was considered
the only way to prevent action theory from starting with a
rigid abstraction and thus, secondly, from becoming divorced from
the situational and biographical context of action. But thirdly, and
above all, this way of proceeding was seen as the best safeguard
against another danger: namely that the consideration of human action
should be forced to adhere to the dictates of a conception of rationality
to such an extent that the broad spectrum of different phenomena of
action should appear primarily as examples of a lack of rationality p.196

The creativity of action does not contain a push to fit concepts into themodel .

Instead we try to understand how human action functions, rather than putting them into our model.
