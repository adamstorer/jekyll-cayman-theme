## Human Condition
### Chapter 4

#### The Durability of the world

Arendt argues that it is mostly the work of our hands, (that done by homo faber) is what is generally seen as valuable, that which has enough to make it property. And when workers make things like chairs, though they may be in the end used up, they are wearing out its inherent durability.

Arendt argues that men can see their sameness in a chair, their subjectivity can be understood as the same with respect to the objectivity of the table, whereas untouched nature is simply indifferent to the distinction.

Arendt wonders about the difference between the words "use" and "consumption" - What distinguishes them is that they do not wear out on their own - they must be used in order to wear out - not like food which spoils.

The distinction is similar to that between work and Labor: Tilling seems to labor that transforms itself into work. Tilling leaves some product behind and gets the world ready to be built. But, it is still laboring because it requires cultivation! It still needs to be labored upon.

<def>reification: the produced thing in its existence is secured once and for all</def>

#### Reification
Fabrication consists in reification! Only homo faber, the fabricator of the world, takes hold over the world. Even laborers do not do this because they are actually still remains a servant to the world.

There is a painful effort expended in all human labor, and the violence that we do against the earth to fabricate it is its exact opposite.

What we are supposedto pay attention to is the difference between the "private" feelings the indiviual has and the mental images we make of a bed before we build it.

Arendt argues the fabricated thing is an end procuct both because it comes to an end in it, and also that it's only a means to produce an end. Labor produces the end of consumption, but teh thigns to be consumed are not at all permanent. Labor is cyclical but work has a clear end, it simply is when it finishes.

#### Instrumentality and Animal Laborans
Man is a tool maker - The things designed for the worker to produce more easily or more quickly are produced using "work" with an objective and an end. I am reminded here of the trajectory of history - working on something has a trajectory in a similar way. When laborers use these tools to produce something for consumption, they lose their instrumental character.
>Labor implements are drawn into this rhythm until body
and tool swing in the same repetitive movement, that is, until, in
the use of machines, which of all implements are best suited to the
performance of the animal laborans, it is no longer the body's movement
that determines the implement's movement but the machine's
movement which enforces the movements of the body. The point is
that nothing can be mechanized more easily and less artificially
than the rhythm of the labor process, which in its turn corresponds
to the equally automatic repetitive rhythm of the life process and
its metabolism with nature. p.146

The builders made tools in order to erect a world, not for labor. But now we see these tools only to exist for processes of labor.
>To design objects for the operational capacity of the machine
instead of designing machines for the production of certain objects
would indeed be the exact reversal of the means-end category,
if this category still made any sense.
p.152


#### Instrumentality and Homo faber
For the fabricator, in the work process everything is judged in terms of suitability and usefulness for the desired end - nothing else.

The thing that the fabricator produces is not an end in itself. The chair becomes an object for use. There is a lot of philosophizing here about the categories of means and ends and where it stops with respect to homo faber and whether man is an end in himself - and I'm having a lot of trouble making sense of what this has to do with respect to the work/labor divide.

The question is - if we are building things not to consume but to use, we still must ask, what do we want to use them for? What things are we building to use and why? We are not producing to produce, but in work itself we do not have the reason why we produce.

#### The Exchange Market

The exchange market is the public place that is constructed by homo faber. Of course, these were not fabroicators, and this place of the market is where those who did not produce these things turned them into commodities.
>For it is only in
the exchange market, where everything can be exchanged for
something else, that all things, whether they are products of labor
or work, consumer goods or use objects, necessary for the life of
the body or the convenience of living or the life of the rnind, become
"values."
p. 163-164

In this public realm, the product of work is given value, it is esteemed, demanded, or neglected. This value cannot be possessed in privacy, but is based on whether it is wanted.


#### The permanenance of the world and the work of art
Some things can only be arbitrarily price because they don't have any strict utility - And works of art are the most durable of these things because they are hardly sused at all.
>In the case of art works, reification is more than mere transformation;
it is transfiguration, a veritable metamorphosis in which it
is as though the course of nature which wills that all fire burn to
ashes is reverted and even dust can burst into flames
p.168

Arendt then distingishes between forms of thought, using poetry as the thing that is "made" that is the closest to sharing thought. The question is, once we build a world, what is it for? It must be of action that is entirely different from fabrication or consumption - it is thought.
