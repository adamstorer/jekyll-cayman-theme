Althusser is concerned with Marx v Hegel idealism vs materialism.

>We are now concerned with
the dialectic and the dialectic alone. It might be thought that when Marx writes
that we must 'discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell ' he means that
the 'rational kernel ' is the dialectic itself, while the 'mystical shell ' is speculative
philosophy, Engels's time-honoured distinction between method and system
implies precisely this. p. 90

I think this is something different. But Marx also claims to invert hegel, what do we really mean?

>So I think that, in its approximation, this metaphorical expression -- the
'inversion' of the dialectic -- does not pose the problem of the nature of the objects
to which a single method should be applied (the world of the Idea for Hegel -- the
real world for Marx), but rather the problem of the nature of the dialectic
considered itself; that is, the problem of its specific structures ; not the problem of
the inversion of the 'sense' of the dialectic, but that of the transformation of its
structures. p.93

So the idea is that Hegel's dialectic (negation - negation of negation - supersessions) itself is different for Marx. This is important for some reason but we dont' see why.

For Lenin there is the weakest link ( a chain is only as strong as its weakest link). How was the revolution possible in russia? Once imperialist war started the weak link was broken and we became objectively revolutionary.

>The unevenness of capitalist
development led, via the 1914-18 War, to the Russian Revolution because in the
revolutionary situation facing the whole of humanity Russia was the weakest link
in the chain of imperialist states. It had accumulated the largest sum of historical
contradictions then possible; for it was at the same time the most backward and
the most advanced nation, a gigantic contradiction which its divided ruling classes
could neither avoid nor solve. In other words Russia was overdue with its
bourgeois revolution on the eve of its proletarian revolution; pregnant with two
revolutions, it could not withhold the second even by delaying the first p.97

Here is how the dialectic is different, I think:
>that, if the general contradiction (it has already been specified:
the contradiction between the forces of production and the relations of production,
essentially embodied in the contradiction between two antagonistic classes) is
sufficient to define the situation when revolution is the 'task of the day', it cannot
of its own simple, direct power induce a 'revolutionary situation', nor a fortiori a
situation of revolutionary rupture and the triumph of the revolution. If this
contradiction is to become 'active ' in the strongest sense to become a ruptural
principle, there must be an accumulation of 'circumstances' and 'currents' so that
whatever their origin and sense (and many of them will necessarily be
paradoxically foreign to the revolution in origin and sense, or even its 'direct
opponents'), they 'fuse ' into a ruptural unity : when they produce the result of the
immense majority of the popular masses grouped in an assault on a regime which
its ruling classes are unable to defend.[19] Such a situation presupposes not only
the 'fusion' of the two basic conditions into a 'single national crisis', but each
condition considered (abstractly) by itself presupposes the 'fusion' of an
'accumulation' of contradictions. How else could the class-divided popular masses
(proletarians, peasants, petty bourgeois) throw themselves together, consciously
or unconsciously, into a general assault on the existing regime? p.99

The revolution, I think, and the dialectic according to Marx, is overdetermined.
>the 'contradiction' is
inseparable from the total structure of the social body in which it is found,
inseparable from its formal conditions of existence, and even from the instances it
governs; it is radically affected by them, determining, but also determined in one
and the same movement, and determined by the various levels and instances of
the social formation it animates; it might be called overdetermined in its
principle p.101

The notion of overdetermination is what makes it different from Hegel. For Hegel contradictions are complex, but for Marx they are simple. For Hegel,

>at each moment of its development
consciousness lives and experiences its own essence (the essence corresponding
to the stage it has attained) through all the echoes of the essence it has previously
been, and through the allusive presence of the corresponding historical forms.
Hegel, therefore, argues that every consciousness has a suppressed-conserved
(aufgehoben ) past even in its present, and a world p.101

Apparently we have some overdetermination in Philosophy of Histroy, but again there is some internal dynamic, rather than than external force. That is, all complexities outside are based on one internal dynamic - that of spirit.

>IT is why his philosophy of history is
garnished with uniformly 'dialectical' mutations. This stupefying conception is
only defensible from the Spirit's topmost peak. From that vantage point what does
it matter if a people die once it has embodied the determinate principle of a
moment of the Idea (which has plenty more to come), once, having embodied it, it
has cast it off to add it to that Self-Memory which is History, thereby delivering it
to such and such another people (even if their historical relation is very tenuous!),
who, reflecting it in their substance, will find in it the promise of their own
internal principle, that is, as if by chance the logically consecutive moment of the
Idea, etc. etc.? p. 103

Hegel's dialectic is built on this notion of spirit, as the end ideological goal showing up.

So what is the inversion?

To figure this out, we must make sense of the exceptions to the pure hegelian dialectic, all the failed uprisings. Marx and Engels argue
>They draw from them the basic notion
that the Capital-Labour contradiction is never simple, but always specified by the
historically concrete forms and circumstances in which it is exercised. It is
specified by the forms of the superstructure (the State, the dominant ideology,
religion, politically organized movements, and so on); specified by the internal
and external historical situation which determines it on the one hand as a function
of the national past (completed or 'relapsed' bourgeois revolution, feudal
exploitation eliminated wholly, partially or not at all, local 'customs' specific
national traditions, even the 'etiquette' of political struggles and behaviour, etc.),
and on the other as functions of the existing world context (what dominates it --
competition of capitalist nations, or 'imperialist internationalism', or competition
within imperialism, etc.), many of these phenomena deriving from the 'law of
uneven development' in the Leninist sense. p. 106


For Althusser, what is an overdetermined contradiction? It may be either overdetermined in the direction of a historical inhibition, or in the direction of a revolutionary rupture, but is never found in the pure state. The contradiction, is the one in the system, between capitalisma nd labor I think.

So then, what is the reason for such overdetermination?
>if we cannot demonstrate the necessary link that
unites the characteristic structure of contradiction for Marx to his conception of
society and history, if this overdetermination is not based on the very concepts of
the Marxist theory of history, the category will remain 'up in the air'. For however
accurate and verified it may be in political practice, we have only so far used it
descriptively, that is, contingently, and like an descriptions it is still at the mercy
of any philosophical theory that happens to come along p. 107

For Hegel, the dialectic is based on the internal principles of each society. For Marx, the material life of men explains their history.

I am wondering, looking at this, of drawing out the separation of Hegel and Marx and putting more into Marx, how we draw a similarity between the supremacy of the mode of production and any "superstructure" type things.

SO what are Althusser's version of Marx's terms:
1. Structure - economic base, forces of production and relations of production
2. Superstructure - the state and all the legal, political and ideological forms.

And we also have
1. Determination in the last instance by the structure
2. Relative autonomy of the superstructures and their specific effectivity.

But of course, the question is, to what extent are structure and superstructure correlated?

Engels states:
>Anyone who 'twists this '
so that it says that the economic factor is the only determinant factor, 'transforms
that proposition into a meaningless, abstract, empty phrase '. And as explanation:
'The economic situation is the basis, but the various elements of the
superstructure the political forms of the class struggle and its results: to wit
constitutions established by the victorious class after a successful battle, etc.,
juridical forms, and then even the reflexes of all these actual struggles in the
brains of the participants, political, juristic, philosophical theories, religious
views and their further development into systems of dogmas -- also exercise their
influence upon the course of the historical struggles, and in many cases
preponderate in determining their form p.112

The economy is determinant, but only really in the last instance. The theoretical solution is there if others are willing to take it or not.

The superstructure then, is
>-- it is sufficient to retain from him what should be called
the accumulation of effective determinations (deriving from the superstructures
and from special national and international circumstances) on the determination in
the last instance by the economic. p.113

>his overdetermination is inevitable and thinkable as soon as the
real existence of the forms of the superstructure and of the national and
international conjuncture has been recognized -- an existence largely specific and
autonomous, and therefore irreducible to a pure phenomenon. We must carry this
through to its conclusion and say that this overdetermination does not just refer to
apparently unique and aberrant historical situations (Germany, for example), but
is universal ; the economic dialectic is never active in the pure state p.113

Overdetermined, in a way, then, is that there are many many determinants here. And we must understand how the superstructure works.

There is also survivals! People who still seem to think a different way:
>What is its theoretical
status? Is it essentially social or 'psychological' ? Can it be reduced to the survival
of certain economic structures which the Revolution was unable to destroy with
its first decrees: for example, the small-scale production (primarily peasant
production in Russia) which so preoccupied Lenin? Or does it refer as much to
other structures, political, ideological structures, etc.: customs, habits, even
'traditions ' such as the 'national tradition ' with its specific traits? p. 114

For Marx, the past plays an active effect on constructing poeples realities. IT is one of the detrminatis. Part of overdetermination of a contradiction is:
1. Revolution in the structure does not ipso facto modify the existing superstructures and particularly the ideologies at one blow
2.  The new society produced by a revolution may itself ensure the survival of old forms .

</def>What is overdetermined contradiction?: The structure (means of production and relations of production) produce an inherent contradiction. However, the determinants of how the contradiciton is dealt with is based on more than the structure. It is based also on the superstructure, the set of all other ideas floating out in the world. Even after a revolution, some past determinant, such as old ideologies, can stick around.</def>

The ultimate question I have from this  is - what is the total focus on Marx all about? In other words, could there be revolutions in other ways based on contradictions outside of the structure?
