Abstract: "There is a small but consistent tendency for men who work in bureaucratic organizations to be more intellectually flexible, more open to new experience, and more self-directed in their values than are men who work in nonbureaucratic organizations. This may in part result from bureaucracies' drawing on a more educated work force. In larger part, though, it appears to be a consequence of occupational conditions attendant on bureaucratization- notably, far greater job protections, somewhat higher income, and substantively more com- plex work."

We basically just agree that Merton is right. Kohn wants to know if working in a Bureaucracy makes men automotons, or does it encourage anything else? Kohn wants to know if bureaucrats are conformists and how bureaucratization impacts individuals.

Kohn interviewed 3101 men, meant to be a representative sample.

Kohn looks at how bureaucratic the job is based on how hierarchically the jobs are organized.

>Thus, the index of bureaucratization is as follows: (1) One level of supervision; (2) two levels of supervision; (3) three or more levels of supervision, fewer than 100 employees; (4) three or more levels of supervision, 100-999 employees; and (5) three or more levels of supervision, 1,000 or more employees. p.463

Then we have some outcomes:
1. Valuation of Conformity - Do men value self-direction? If so, they may not have taken on the idea of bureaucracy so fully.
2. Social Orientation - Are people open to non conformity? Are people receptive to change?
3. Intellectual Functioning - Are they smart? There are tests that people do.

Who do you include in the sample? For this it is everyone in a civilian occupation, any job not in the army!

The findings are not expected though, people tend to value self direction and are more open minded. They are more flexible in solving problems.

I think this is because there is more to bureaucracy than a hierarchy. It is more about how routinized the job is. Strangely, government employees seem to be overall more tolerant of all the things bureaucrats shouldn't be.

But what about white collar people? We do not see a big difference between blue and white collar workers?

The question might be something like this - Do questions about abstract values really get to the heart of how people actually feel? Especially if the question itself is asked in such a way, or if people have ever thought about the question before. Education seems to be really the thing that is making a difference here.

>The explanation of these differences must lie either in bureaucracies' somehow recruiting more self-directed, intellectually flexible people (a possibility to which we shall return), or in bureaucracies' subjecting their employees to occupational conditions that foster these social psychological attributes.


It seems that some aspects of the job have a particular effect - controlling for job protections, income, and substantive complexity reduce the bureaucracy effect to insignificance.

>Observers of bureaucracy, impressed by its need to coordinate many people's activi- ties, have assumed that a primary effect of bureaucratization must be to suppress em- ployees' individuality. We have found, to the contrary, that bureaucratization is con- sistently, albeit not strongly, associated with greater intellectual flexibility, higher valua- tion of self-direction, greater openness to new experience, and more personally re- sponsible moral standards. In part, this seems to result from bureaucracies' drawing on a more educated work force. In larger part, it seems to be a consequence of the occupational conditions attendant on bureau- cratization-far greater job protections, somewhat higher levels of income, and sub- stantively more complex work. Job pro- tections matter particularly for bureaucracy's impact on blue-collar workers; substantive complexity, for its impact on white-collar workers. p.472

They point out many issues but probably none of them, that is the specification of certain aspects of the model, selection issues, only having size as a measure of bureaucracy, are as important as the specification of the independent variables. Are we really capturing the things that Merton is discussing in the questions about conformity? Why or why not?
