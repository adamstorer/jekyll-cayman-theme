The reading for this section is: â€¢	Parsons, Talcott and Edward A. Shils. 1951. "Values, Motives and Systems of Action." Pp. 47-275 in Toward a General Theory of Action, edited by Talcott Parsons and Edward A. Shils. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.

### Chapter 1 Categories of the Orientation and Organization of Action


This is about human behavior, which has four aspects:
1. Oriented towards end goals
2. Takes place in situations
3. Is normatively regulated
4. Involves expenditure of energy or effort or motivation.

Actors act in relations to objects, which can be physical, human, or cultural objects. The relationships to these objects is a system of orientations.

Where does the energy or motivation come from? -  Maybe humans have some kind of energy potential, but to fully understand this you need to understand how the norms work.

What about organization of action into systems? Constellations of actions become systems, and they are organized social, personal, or cultural systems.

A social system of action hsa the follwoing characteristics (p.55)
<def>Social System 1: Interaction between two or more actors</def>
<def>Social System 2: Other actors also act, and ego's actions take into account alter's previous actions as well as potential future action when considering some action</def>
<def>Social System 3: There is interdependent work that functions towards a collective goal or common values, and there is some consensus of expectations</def>

A personality system has these characteristics:
<def>Personality System 1: The system comprising the interconnections of the actions of an individual actor</def>
<def>Personality System 2: The actor's actions are organized by a structure of need-dispositions</def>
<def>Personality System 3: Single actors have a determinate organization of comapitbility of integration, so the actions of the single actor have a determinate organization of compatabiltiy or integration with one another</def>

And finally, a cultural system!
<def>Cultural System 1: A system organize by values, norms, and symbols which guide the choices made by actors and which limit the types of interaction which occur among actors</def>
<def>Cultural System 2: Not an empirical system, because it is abstract. They may exist separately as physical symbols and be transmitted from one empirical action to another</def>
<def>Cultural System 3: Patterns of regulatory norms cannot be made up of random or unrelated elements. It must have a certain degree of consistency</def>
<def>Cultural System 4: Patterns of culture whose different parts are interrelated to form value systems, belief systems, and systems of expressive symbols</def>

In my own thinking about culture, it is these last two elements that seem the most outrageous. But is it? We may have some system of values that people interpret differently with respect to some action, but that doesn't negate the abstract notions? But there is a degree to which consistency is built in as part of the system. In any LIVING system, each part of the system is under potentially non-systematic attack.  But remember, from p.56 the patterns of culture need to be instituationalized in social systems and internalized in personality system in order to guide the actor to the ends.


There are a lot of repetitive definitions over the next few pages that I'm not going to take a ton of notes on.

What strikes me though is that this is a question of value-orientation on p.59. The value orientations may commit you to certain norms. Parsons is confident this will end up bringing us to some organized set of rules, but it may just as likely be disorganized. But the spread of value orientations is really an empirical system.

<def>Cognitive mode of value-orientation: Thinking carefully about how certain actions fit within categories and standards</def>
<def>Appreciative mode of value-orientation: Standards about the appropriateness or consistency of something, such as a pattern of gratification (I like this type of music)</def>
<def>Moral mode of value-orientation: Considering the consequences of actions, and how responsible an individual will feel for the consequences of some action on the social system. </def>


This mode of theorizing is different from biological thought because we are not concerned about physiological problems. We are all strutured systems operating in structured systems that are relational etierh with respect to other people obviously or within our personality. It is also different from biology because things are not done with respect to survival, but what is appropriate based on cultural values.


#### Orientation to the Situation
What defines orientation to the situation? This seems like a bunch of relatively obvious statements about how people decideto go about wanting something, such as "narrowing the range of objects wanted, sorting 'appropriate' from 'inappropriate' goal objects, and deciding whether the alternatives are moral or not.
