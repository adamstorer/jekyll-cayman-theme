The reading for this section is: •	Parsons, Talcott and Edward A. Shils. 1951. "Values, Motives and Systems of Action." Pp. 47-275 in Toward a General Theory of Action, edited by Talcott Parsons and Edward A. Shils. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.

### Chapter 1 Categories of the Orientation and Organization of Action


This is about human behavior, which has four aspects:
1. Oriented towards end goals
2. Takes place in situations
3. Is normatively regulated
4. Involves expenditure of energy or effort or motivation.

Actors act in relations to objects, which can be physical, human, or cultural objects. The relationships to these objects is a system of orientations.

Where does the energy or motivation come from? -  Maybe humans have some kind of energy potential, but to fully understand this you need to understand how the norms work.

What about organization of action into systems? Constellations of actions become systems, and they are organized social, personal, or cultural systems.

A social system of action hsa the follwoing characteristics (p.55)
<def>Social System 1: Interaction between two or more actors</def>
<def>Social System 2: Other actors also act, and ego's actions take into account alter's previous actions as well as potential future action when considering some action</def>
<def>Social System 3: There is interdependent work that functions towards a collective goal or common values, and there is some consensus of expectations</def>

A personality system has these characteristics:
<def>Personality System 1: The system comprising the interconnections of the actions of an individual actor</def>
<def>Personality System 2: The actor's actions are organized by a structure of need-dispositions</def>
<def>Personality System 3: Single actors have a determinate organization of comapitbility of integration, so the actions of the single actor have a determinate organization of compatabiltiy or integration with one another</def>

And finally, a cultural system!
<def>Cultural System 1: A system organize by values, norms, and symbols which guide the choices made by actors and which limit the types of interaction which occur among actors</def>
<def>Cultural System 2: Not an empirical system, because it is abstract. They may exist separately as physical symbols and be transmitted from one empirical action to another</def>
<def>Cultural System 3: Patterns of regulatory norms cannot be made up of random or unrelated elements. It must have a certain degree of consistency</def>
<def>Cultural System 4: Patterns of culture whose different parts are interrelated to form value systems, belief systems, and systems of expressive symbols</def>

In my own thinking about culture, it is these last two elements that seem the most outrageous. But is it? We may have some system of values that people interpret differently with respect to some action, but that doesn't negate the abstract notions? But there is a degree to which consistency is built in as part of the system. In any LIVING system, each part of the system is under potentially non-systematic attack.  But remember, from p.56 the patterns of culture need to be instituationalized in social systems and internalized in personality system in order to guide the actor to the ends.

What strikes me though is that this is a question of value-orientation on p.59. The value orientations may commit you to certain norms. Parsons is confident this will end up bringing us to some organized set of rules, but it may just as likely be disorganized. But the spread of value orientations is really an empirical system.

<def>Cognitive mode of value-orientation: Thinking carefully about how certain actions fit within categories and standards</def>
<def>Appreciative mode of value-orientation: Standards about the appropriateness or consistency of something, such as a pattern of gratification (I like this type of music)</def>
<def>Moral mode of value-orientation: Considering the consequences of actions, and how responsible an individual will feel for the consequences of some action on the social system. </def>


This mode of theorizing is different from biological thought because we are not concerned about physiological problems. We are all structured systems operating in structured systems that are relational either with respect to other people obviously or within our personality. It is also different from biology because things are not done with respect to survival, but what is appropriate based on cultural values.



## Classification of Objects
We are coming up with some overall theory of action, and in doing so we need to understand the actors frame of reference. That is what was done above.

WE break down objects into two types: social and nonsocial.
Social objects are interactive. That is, another person or another group. We act towards social objects with the expectation that we'll get some kind of reaction from them. The same object may be seen as social or nonsocial depending on whose perspective we are considering. We can also differentiate objects by the qualities they have and the performances they make.

This talk of objects reminds me a lot of Bruno Latour's theories of the duality of social and nonsocial objects, put together in a way that is much easier to follow.

There are also physical and cultural (nonsocial) objects, which is their transferability. Cultural objects can be transferred without the physical object themselves (I would love an example here) while physical objects need that actual object.

#### Orientation to the Situation
What defines orientation to the situation? This seems like a bunch of relatively obvious statements about how people decideto go about wanting something, such as "narrowing the range of objects wanted, sorting 'appropriate' from 'inappropriate' goal objects, and deciding whether the alternatives are moral or not.

>Besides the aspects mentioned above, the salient features of an actor's
orientation are these: (1) There is orientation to discriminated and related objects;
various things are seen or expected, and they are seen or expected in
relational contexts. (2) There is orientation to goals; various things are
wanted. (3) There is orientation to the gratification-deprivation significance
of the various courses of action suggested by the situation, and there is comparison
of the gratification-deprivation balance presented by each of the alternative
courses. (4) There is orientation to standards of acceptability which (a)
narrow the range of cognitions, sorting "veridical" from "nonveridical" object-
orientation; (6) narrow the range of objects wanted, sorting "appropriate"
from "inappropriate" goal objects; and (c) narrow the number of alternatives,
sorting "moral" from "immoral" courses of action. p.68

People may become attached to a certain object and their "need-dispositions" require this thing. People may even become attached to categories of objects.

WE have three basic modes of motivational orientation:

1. Cognitive - One discriminates between objects
2. Cathectic - One decides how desirable certain objects are.
3. Evaluation - "the organizational or integrative aspect of a given actor's system of action and hence it is directly relevant to the act of choice." p.70

And how exactly do people value things? They combine these motivational orientations with the above described modes of value orientation.

Different types of activity lead to different types of action:

>the three basic types
are: (a) intellectual activity, where cognitive interests prevail and cognitive
value standards have primacy (i.e., investigation or the "search for knowledge")
; (6) expressive action, where cathectic interests and appreciative
standards have primacy (i.e., the search for direct gratification) ; and (c)
responsible or moral action, where evaluative interests and moral standards
have primacy (i.e., the attempt to integrate actions in the interest of a larger
system of action). p.75

Based on orientations, you come to certain classifications defining how you view a system.
<def>What is a pattern variable?: a pattern variable is a dichotomy, one side of which must be chosen by an actor before the meaning of a situation is determinate for him, and thus before he can act with respect to that situation p.77</def>

What types of patterns are we seeing? There are only five.
1. Affectivity-Affective neutrality.
2. Self-orientation-Collectivity-orientation.
3. Universalism-Particularism.
4. Ascription—Achievement.
5. Specificity-Diffuseness.

Parsons Descritipon:
>The first concerns the problem of whether or not evaluation is to take
place in a given situation. The second concerns the primacy of moral standards
in an evaluative procedure. The third concerns the relative primacy of
cognitive and cathectic standards. The fourth concerns the seeing of objects
as quality or performance complexes. The fifth concerns the scope of significance
of the object. p.78

There is a ton of definition of pattern variables in the following pages.

## Classification of Need-Dispositions and Role-Expectations
>In principle, therefore, every concrete need-disposition of personality,
or every role-expectation of social structure, involves a combination of
values of the five pattern variables. The cross-classification of each of the
five against each of the others, yielding a table of thirty-two cells, will, on the
assumption that the list of pattern variables is exhaustive, produce a classification
of the basic value patterns. Internalized in the personality system,
these value patterns serve as a starting point for a classification of the possible
types of need-dispositions; as institutionalized in the system of social
action, they are a classification of components of role-expectation definitions. p.93

Ok, this is going pretty in depth and would require more time to understand it fully than I'm willing to put in right now. However, I am very sympathetic to Parsons approach here, even if in reality is dry and dense. That is, define everything and every aspect of everything. I do wonder if so far we miss out on some interesting sociological concepts. For instance, Michels argues that large democratic parties ultimately produce oligarchy because the organizational structure of bureaucracy is incompatible with democracy. It shifts the orientations of the bureaucrats away from the democratic source. I wonder if such an idea could fit into Parsons system.

But the larger idea, as far as I can tell, is that a system such as this allows us to communicate. If parts are not there originally, we can add them in. If some descriptions are bad, we can update them. But it gives us a foundational structure that allows for observation to build in a systematic way.

## The Concept of System and the Classification of Types of Systems
Parsons on Systems:
>The most general and fundamental
property of a system is the interdependence of parts or variables.
Interdependence consists in the existence of determinate relationships among
the parts or variables as contrasted with randomness of variability. In other
words, interdependence is order in the relationship among the components
which enter into a system. This order must have a tendency to self-maintenance,
which is very generally expressed in the concept of equilibrium.^^ It
need not, however, be a static self-maintenance or a stable equilibrium. It
may be an ordered process of change — a process following a determinate
pattern rather than random variability relative to the starting point. p.107

I am not sure if the self-maintenance aspect must really be around for this to function properly, but what do I know?
