One of the main arguments is that history basically proceeds through Class Struggle. The bourgeosie continues to advance through all class struggle from ancient accumulation to feudalism.

When the bourgeoisie start to build markets, market forces force them everywhere, connecting all individuals and improving the instruments of production. They draw all individuals into one connected world market.

Every once in a while we get too much, the productive forces of society and must be burned down so they can start anew.

Meanwhile, individuals become commodities, doing boring work, while at the same time all connected with each other. In addition, people are getting paid less and less.

>The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual
labour, in other words, the more modern industry becomes developed,
the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women .
Differences o f age and sex have no longer any distinctive social
validity for the working class . All are instruments of labour, mOre or
less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.
p.479

In addition, many who were part of other classes instead become part of one large workers class. Soon factories struggle together, then unions, then as a government party. These unions provide political bases for struggle at the level of the political party.

Since the proletariat will eventually form one large class for the people, undifferentiated, there will be no more classes once this is over.   

>All previous historical movements were movements of minorities,
or in the interests of minorities . The proletarian movement is the
self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in
the interests of the immense majority. The proletariat, the lowest
stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up,
without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being
sprung into the air.
p.483

Communists will then show up who have the same general idea. Their ideas spring naturally from the way that the mode of production creates material reality. Then there is no property at all.

>You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property.
But in your existing society, private property is already done
away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the
few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine tenths
. You reproach us, therefore, with intending to do away with
a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is
the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of
society.
p.486

>Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man's ideas,
views and conceptions, in one word, man's consciousness, changes
with every ch:mge in the conditions o f his material existence, in his
social relations and i n his social life? p.489


Marx Also has 10 ideas for what communism will kind of look like.

1. Abolition of property in land and application o f all rents of
land to public purposes .
2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
3. Abolition of all right of inheritance.
4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.
5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State, by means of
a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.
6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport
in the hands of the State .
7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by
the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement
of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.
8. Equal liability of all to labour. Establishment of industrial armies,
especially for agriculture .
9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries;
gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country, by a
more equable distribution of the population over the country.
10. Free education for all children in public schools . Abolition of children's factory labour in its present form. Combination of education  with industrial production


In addition, here are some note from when I taught the communist manifesto:
Mode of Production – Fedualism – you own the land and peasants are tied to the land
o	Forces of Production  - Complex agriculture with human and non-human work.
•	The methods we use to make stuff
o	Relations of Production – Some people own others
•	The way we organize production, how we use the forces of production.

o	Classes – nobility/aristocracy (could not augment their income)
•	In each mode of production we have people who labor and people who profit off the labor of others. There are often other intermediary groups who hold some sort of status in the middle.  
•	Class conscioussness
o	The State – essentially a superstructure! Something that sits on top of the economy to make sure its reproduced. It also protects the interest of those who are in power.
o	Appeal to authority – There is some reason why we’re in charge!
  QUESTION -
o	When do you become conscious of your class status? Of the possibility for a differnet way of doing things?
•	Your conceptions of what you are and what is possible is a result of the mode of production.  
o	Relations of production have a dialectic force between the highest class and the middle class, which is spurred by forces of production.  The middle class has a revolution, takes hold, and recreates a system of appropriation with them at the top! New technologies are developed which force this to happen new relations of production.

•	Capitalism as a mode of production – Spend 5 minutes talking about capitalism specifically as a means of production – Start with the quote on p. 58.
o		What does this mean for classes?
•	It is true that different classes exist, but as competition becomes more intense and the forces of production develop, large corporations will need to swoop in and own small businesses, will have to cut the costs of managers, etc.

o	Private Property
•	 This is different than other eras! You own what you own and if you work hard you can get more, everyone has the chance to do well. People are not in power for any other reason than that they own the most stuff!  What in particular do you own! You own yourself
•	Your labor power is your most important piece of private property! It is the one thing that you sell to capitalists.
•	In the eyes of capitalists labor power all looks the same – no real difference between men and women and adults and children.
o	Globalizing Force
•	Constant need to expand and move to new markets.
o	Constant and rapid improvement of machinery, automating processes and reducing the technical skills that humans need.

o	IT agglomerates population, centralizes means of production, and concentrates property in a few hands.
•	What does Marx think is happening with Gender? Do you agree?
o	Hegemony - There perhaps needs to be a system where everyone agrees with the general ideology of capitalism. So you have some underlying idea about how individuals relate to the economy.
•	Examfples of the hegemonic nature of capitalism today? What about Donald Trump as president?
o	The falling rate of profits – there is some desire to save labor and there is less actual value added. As we produce more and more
o	Accumulation crises! – We have made too much and the people can’t afford it!
o	Finally, there is the realization that the capitalists need the wage-laborers, but the laborers have no need for the capitalists. The capitalists just sit around and collect profits! Here we have a simplified society so that when the next mode of production comes by, it is the rise of all against few!
o	Where do the workers organize? Trade unions and the shop floor? This is a new class for itself by itself.
