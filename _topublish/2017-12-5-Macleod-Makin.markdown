# Part 1

Occupatioanl aspirations related to class lines. These are something like "leveled aspirations"

It is weird because the place isn't really so bad, though 85% are single parent homes and 70% are on public assistance.

Hallway Hangers - white boys wo hang out in the hallway - not optimistic
Brothers - blacks. Brothers are optimistic

>Social reproduction theory identifies the barriers
to social mobility, barriers that constrain without completely blocking
lower- and working-class individuals’ efforts to break into the upper reaches of
the class structure. p.8

>Once we have familiarized ourselves with this academic viewpoint, we shall
switch perspectives abruptly to the streets to consider how the Brothers and
Hallway Hangers understand their social circumstances. How do they view their
prospects for social upgrading, and how does this estimation affect their aspirations?
What unseen social and economic forces daily influence these boys? How
do they make sense of and act upon the complex and often contradictory messages
emanating from their family, peer group, workplace, and school?

## Social Reproduction
Why do people end upi n the same lass?

These are "reproduction theorists"who "analyze how the class structure is reproduced from one generation to the next."

For Instance, bowles and gintis argue that schools socialize students to occupy the same class position.

Bourdieu is all about cultural capital and habitus, the external and internal aspects of culture that result in exclusion.
>Bourdieu’s theory consists of four main points. First, distinctive cultural capital
is transmitted by each social class. Second, the school systematically valorizes
upper-class cultural capital and depreciates the cultural capital of the
lower classes. Third, differential academic achievement is retranslated back into
economic wealth—the job market remunerates the superior academic credentials
earned mainly by the upper classes. Finally, the school legitimates this process
“by making social hierarchies and the reproduction of those hierarchies
appear to be based upon the hierarchy of ‘gifts,’ merits, or skills established and
ratified by its sanctions, or, in a word, by converting social hierarchies into academic
hierarchies.” p.14

And then habitus is dispositions people ahve. Others argue that linguistic cultural capital, modes of speech, are also part of what goe son here.

In other words, we need to understand how social reproduction is lived out to underand the mechanisms behind reproduction. This is the habitus style version of the argument, but also the methodological concern of the argument.

But there is also some subjectivity. Girous is meant to show that there is agency, and part of this agency is shown in resistance.

The book itself is supposed to be focused on agency.
>This book intends to delve beneath the surface of teenage behavior to recover
the interests, concerns, and logic that render it comprehensible. p.22

# The Setting

The hallway hangers, who see there as being no point in all of this, have a lot of solidarity which they care about. This is super important because their in-group stops them from making it.

And people feel stigma from living in the projects. The hallway hangers dont' like black people and see them as an economic threat.

>The resentment the Hallway Hangers feel toward blacks and the destructive
consequences that flow from this hatred could not be more plainly exposed. By
pointing to the economic and social factors that feed this racism, I do not mean
to absolve the Hallway Hangers of responsibility for their racist attitudes and
beliefs, much less for the violence to which these give rise. Racism is a sickness
that rots American society, but those who see it simply as a matter of individual
pathology overlook the social conditions that contribute to its outbreak and
spread. We can blame the Hallway Hangers, but we also must blame the economic
and social conditions of lower-class life under competitive capitalism. p.45

So is their racism like an individual thing or what?

### The Brothers

>The Brothers, in contrast to the Hallway Hangers, are not a distinctive subculture
with its own set of shared values. The Brothers accept the dominant culture’s
definitions of success and judge themselves by these criteria. A night in
the city jail would permanently tarnish a Brother’s reputation rather than build
it up. In the eyes of the Brothers, John Grace, the bartender who was involved in
the shootout in Clarendon Heights, would be worthy only of disdain, and perhaps
pity, rather than the respect Frankie accords him. While the Hallway
Hangers have little concern for the judgments of the dominant culture, the
Brothers become uncomfortable and embarrassed when recounting disciplinary
problems they have had at home or in school. Such a “confession” for a
member of the Hallway Hangers, on the other hand, might be accompanied by
laughter and a sense of triumph. p.47

This is really a simmel style argument I think about how Subgroups relate to some sort of main or overall group. Right?

# What socializes the groups?

## Family
>As the focal socializing agency, especially in the early years of a child’s life, the family
plays a crucial role in the process of social reproduction. In this chapter, we consider
the particular circumstances of each boy’s family and how the family influences
his expectations for the future p.51

The brothers have more people who graduated from high school. To be white and in that type of situation you have to be more messed up I think.

The hallway hangers parents don't force them to do anything:
>The respect these parents have for the autonomy of their sons extends to the
way in which they influence their sons’ occupational aspirations. When asked
about the effect their parents have on their ambitions, the Hallway Hangers are
unanimous in their declaration that such a determination is left up to them
alone. p.58

they don't tell them to be ambititous

People are not projecting their frustrated ambition. We have really different parenting styles. The Brothers parents do all of those things.

People really have different views of the opportunity structure.

>If the Hallway Hangers view their predicament as a race in which they, as
members of the lower class, must jump a number of hurdles, while the rest of
the pack can simply sprint, the Brothers see it as an even dash. The Hallway
Hangers believe a strong finish, given their handicap, is out of the question and
drop out of the race before it begins. They cannot understand why the Brothers
compete seriously. Apparently, explains Slick, the Brothers do not see the hurdles.
“It’s a question of you wanna see it, and you don’t wanna see it. They might
not wanna see all the obstacles. In the long run, it’ll hurt them. You hafta hear
what’s going on, or it’s gonna hurt you later on.”
The Brothers, for their part, are lined up at the start, unsure of their ability,
but ready to run what they see as a fair race. They do not understand why the
Hallway Hangers fail to take the competition seriously. It is, after all, the only
game in town p. 82


I think my takeaway might be that the brothers tell themselves very different stories, and as a result they take on very different approaches, reshape their motivations.

# Leveled Aspirations

Really families seem to work to change individual aspirations. I'm not sure the theory sections are super strong, but here it goes:
1. At some point, people make judgements about their potential abilities and level their aspirations based on what is attainable.
2. Within a group, value judgements can differ substantially from those that are valued in some "greater work world." If this is the case, then some groups can reinforce a counter culture and end up with values that work against their success in the outside world.

People also try to make sense of their failures by finding problems in the dominant ideology, blaming themselves, or looking for scapegoats.

At the same time, it's really hard to say what's going on here. There are really too many moving parts.

>This book’s basic finding—that two substantially different paths are followed
within the general framework of social reproduction—is a major challenge to
economically determinist theories. Two groups of boys from the same social
stratum who live in the same housing project and attend the same school nevertheless
experience the process of social reproduction in fundamentally different
ways p.137
