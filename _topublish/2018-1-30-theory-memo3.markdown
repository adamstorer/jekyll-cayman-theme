One of the most difficult questions contemporary sociology has run up against is the extent to which logics are tied to the material world. Swidler (1987), Vaisey (2009), Sewell (1992) and even Bourdieu (1973) all wrestle with the extent to which some ideas or set of ideas correlate with the material world. In my own research, I often also wonder about this question. In my dissertation I plan to study the processes by which doctors take up certain practices, such as prescribing a relatively high level of opioids, or accepting medicaid patients. By analyzing medical claims, I can watch doctors teach each other, work in the same department on the same day, and even work on the same patient. But even with this granular information, it will be all but impossible to understand how doctors conceptualize these practices, and how they make sense of their own learning processes.

The readings for this set of the Qualifying Exam shows that the same question is asked in the Marxist tradition, although with somewhat different framing. That is, to what extent are an individual's or group's ideas (or whatever form you wish to characterize the inner-workings of the mind) determined by the economic structure of society. These readings range in their positions. Lukacs and Marcuse are both of the position that, whether we realize it or not, every action in the "social" realm is truly an instantiation of the economic structure. Gramsci presents a more complex argument, tying political relations more loosely to economic structure. Though there is room for some room for political contigency and maneuvering in Gramsci's thought, in the last element there is a direct structuring of all other realms of action based on economic structure. This is clear to some extent in Gramsci's treatment of Bureaucracy, where Gramsci diverges from Weber's analysis from Bureaucratic principles of rationalization as such by arguing that the form  which bureaucracy takes is dependent in the last instance on the economic structure.

Althusser presents a separate argument. I
