Abstract: "This research examines the effects of work experience on occupational reward values, which are of central importance in occupational choice, career development, and subjective responses to work. Whereas it is often assumed that occupational values remain fixed throughout the work history, a confirmatory factor analysis of data obtained from male college graduates over a 10-year time span demonstrates that work autonomy and income influence intrinsic, people-oriented, and extrinsic values. Rewarding occupational experiences were found to reinforce the same values that constituted the basis of earlier work selection. The findings raise several issues for the study of social in- equality."

>rare. However, Kohn and Schooler's recent study (1978), using longitudinal data collected over a 10-year time span, has shown that socialization and selection pro- cesses together account for the relationship between an important occupa- tional dimension and a central psychological attribute: the substantive com- plexity of work was found to have significant effects on intellectual flexi- bilit

That is, people do change over time in some way.

People think a lot about extrinsic values - about income and prestige, or intrinsic values about how rewarding one finds work.

That is, one gets some reward depending on their values, and chooses a job based on that. But do the values change?

>We further hypothesize that work experiences engender changes in occu- pational values over time. Initial value differences, which constitute the basis for occupational selection, would be heightened by processes of occupational socialization.

There is some sense in which jobs which have high rewards in some areas may create higher value for these things.

>However, if the relationships between work experiences and values found in this study continue to operate throughout the work history, one might expect that they would become increasingly congruent. Values reinforced by previous occupational rewards would continuously engender attempts to maximize the same fulfilling work experiences, either by changing occupa- tional positions or by "molding" the job. p.21
