Wage growth has stagnated! Especially in manufacturing.
Why are wages stagnating?
1. Large corporate buyers keep wages down among their supplier companies.

There's some skill biased technological change and import competition. Workers are less likely to be overpaid with respect to their market power. Maybe if you look at organizational changes you can see how the individuals relate to their workers.

But at the same time there are less surplus with which to reward their workers than previously. For instance in one case WalMart had tons of pressure over warehouse workers.

Social distance of outside buyers like walmart can make demands on workers. There is also some insulation of worker power. The suppliers are so dependent
