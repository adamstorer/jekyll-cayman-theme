# Chapter 1
## Preliminaries

Fields are all about relational thinking, and the literary field is exactly this. Here it is hard to see relational thinking because it is a story of great men more often than that of a field.

>The space o( literary or artistic position-tak ings, i.e. the structured set
of the manifestations of the social agents involved in' the field - literary
or artistic works, of course, but also political acts or pronouncements,
manifestos or polemics, etc. - is inseparable from the space o( literary or
artistic positions p.32

We have a field of forces and struggles, but often we only see a certain person become valorized. WE should not think of art in terms of the actual art here, but in terms of the social relations. Foucault calls the same thing the field of strategic possibilities. But sometimes we must look pass the field of discourse.

>In short, Foucault shifts on to
the plane of possible position-takings the strategies which are generated an d implemented on the sociological plane of positions; he thus refuses
to relate works in any way to their social conditions of production, i.e.
10 position s occupied within the field of cultural production. More
precis ely, he explicitly rejects as a 'doxological illusion' the endeavour to
find in the 'field of polemics' and in 'divergences of interests and mental
habits' between individuals the principle of what occurs in the 'field of
strategic possibilities', which he sees as determined solely by the
'strategic possibilities of the conceptual games' p.33

So how do we think about the field of art?
>ore concretely, they forget that the existence ,
form and direction of change depend not only on the 'state of the
system', i.e. the 'repertoire' of possibilities which it offers, but also on
the balance of forces between social agents who have entirely real
interests in the different possibilities available to them as stakes and who
deploy every sort of strategy to make one set or the other prevail. When
we speak of a field of position-takings, we are insisting that what can be
constituted as a system for the sake of analysis is not the product of a
coherence-seeking intention or an objective consensus (even if it presupposes
unconscious agreement on common principles) but the product
and prize of a permanent conflict; or, to put it another way, that the
generative, unifying principle of this 'system' is the struggle, with all the
contradictions it engenders p. 34

There is:
1. Internal Dynamics of The field - form and Direction, (but these are essentially superstructure)
2. Real position takings based on power and different types of capital (the structure)

In this way we marry the art itself with its conditions of production.

But we must also consider how art comes to be valued. This is its "symbolic production" - which is based on understanding how the object operates within other fields and other aspects of society.

## The Field of Cultural Production and the Field f Power
WE have an artistic field and a power field. The artistic field is relatively autonomous but in the end is dominated by the field of power.

The more autonomous a field becomes, the more we focus on SYMBOLIC power over traditional types of power like economics and profit.

>Thus, al leasl in Ihe most perfectly autonomous sector of the field of
cullural production, where Ihe only audience aimed at is other producers
(as with Symbolist poetry), the economy of practices is based, as
in a generalized game of 'loser wins', on a systematic inversion of the
fundamental principles of all ordinary economies p.39

### Struggle for Dominant Principle of Hierarchization
Basically there is a fight over what the logic of the field will be. Will it operate on similar ideas to other fields - and thus favorably to those who dominate other fields (heteronomously) or opposing other fields and instead following an autonomous principle.

This struggle is inseparable from the struggle with the dominant class (there is an opposition between artists and bourgeois) to impose the dominant principle of domination - $$$$.

The dominant class operates on the principle of a single hierarchy and the dominant class wants that hierarchy to be maintained.

So, one struggle is to determine what the dominant definition of the actors in the field can be. There is never a universally true definition, it is defined mostly by those in power in a field.

We then have boundary struggles, where we delimit the territory held by competing agents.

One of the reasons art has such extreme dispersion and conflicts of legitimacy is that multiple fields fight over the field of art. The most disputed boundary is between art and power.

### Homologies
Homologies - same or similar relations

The field of cultural production produces effects how poeple understand? the relations in the field of power and the field of class reltions.

>These homologies may
give rise to ideological effects which are produced automatically
whenever oppositions at di fferent levels are superimposed or merged.
They are also the basis of partial alliances: the struggles within the fiel d
of power are never entirely independent of the struggle between the
dominated classes and the dominant class, and the logic of the homolo_
gies between the two spaces means that the struggles going on within the
inner field are always overdetermined and always tend to aim at two
birds with one stone. p.44

Even the relationship between art and its audience is, in part determined with respect to the dominant fields - class relations and power.


## Structure of the Field

If the structure of the field is heteronomous, operating on the same logic as money and power, then there is a logic of demand. The relationship to the audience and economic/political success is one of the bases for evaluating producers and products.

>Thus, within the sub-field of production-for-producers, which recognizes
only the specific principle of legitimacy, those who are assured of
the recognition of a certain fraction of the other producers, a presumed
index of posthumous recognition, are opposed to those who, again from
the standpoint of the specific criteria, are relegated to an inferio r
position and who, in accordance with the model of heresy, contest the
legitimation principle dominant within the autonomous sub-field, either
in the name of a new legitimation principle or in the name of a return to
an old one. Likewise, at the other pole of the field, that of the market
and of economic profit, authors who manage to secure 'high-soclery
successes and bourgeois consecration are opposed to those who a re
condemned to so-called 'popular' success - the authors of rural novels,
music-hall artists, chansonniers, etc. p.46

### Genesis of a Structure

We have oppositions based on placement in a field. There are sub-fields related to large scale production and to production for a restricted population, usuaully otherproducers.
The structure of the field of cultural production is based on two different oppositiosn
1. Oppositions between subfields o restricted production and amss production, that is two economies and audiences etc.
2. Within the sub field of the restricted population, between the established figures and the newcomers.

These subfields can operate under different logics. Within the field then, there is an autonomous and a heteronomous subfield.

### Structure and Change

Changes can lead to reconstructions of the field. Changes are different depending on which sub-ield you are operating in. We must understand both the autonomous processes of the field as well as the historical situation.

There is partially an old guard new guard process.

>Because position-takings arise quasi-mechanically - that is, almost
'ndepen dently of the agents' consciousness and wills - from the relation
􀚵hip between positions, they take relatively invariant forms, and being
determined relatlonally, negatIvely, they may remalO Virtually empty,
amounting to little more than a parti pris of refusal, difference, rupture.
Str ucturally 'young' writers, i.e. those less advanced in the process of
consecration (who may be biologically almost as old as the 'old' writers
they seek to oust),3! will refuse everything their 'elders' (in terms of
legi timacy) are and do, and in particular all the indices of social ageing,
starting with the signs of consecration, internal (academies, etc.) or
exter nal (success), whereas the 'old' writers will regard the social
non -existence (in terms of success and consecration) and also the
'obscurity' of their young rivals as evidence of the voluntaristic, forced
character of some endeavours to overtake them p. 59

## Positions and Dispostions

People's practices are based on two histories - the history of their position in the field and the history of their dispositions.

For dispositions, we see the field as a shape of possibilities.

>This sense of social direction which orients agents,
according to their modesty ()I" daring, their disinterestedness or thirst
profit, towards the risky, long-term investments of journalism, serials
the theatre, is the basis of the astonishingly close correspondence that
found between positions and dispositions, between the social choaracreeistics
of 'posts' and the social characteristics of the agents who fill them. p. 64

>If you want to be a producer for itself in the avant garde, you usually have substantial economic and social capital. Thus, it is within each state of the field that - as a function of the
structure of the possibles which are manifested through the different
positions and the properties of the occupants (particularly with respect
to social origin and the corresponding dispositions), and also as a
function of the positions actually and potentially occupied within the
field (experienced as success or failure) - the dispositions associated
with a certain social origin are specified by being enacted in structurally marked practices; p.70

>To make this argument fully convincing, one would have to show
how habituS, as systems of dispositions, are effectively realized only in
rela t ion to a determinate structure of positions socially marked by the
social properties of their occupants, through which they manifest
themselves p. 71

# Chapter 2 - The Production of beliefs

It is difficult to think of art because the things have no value and seem almost anti capitalist. People think this is anti-capitalist but this is only based on an extremely narrow understand of anti-economic.

However, once a field exists one cana ccumulate symbolic capital - that is economic or political capital that is disavowed, misrecognized and therefore recognized as legitimate. IN the long run, symbolic capital turns to economic capital. Additionally, disavowal is something that mostly suits those with money.

## Who creates teh creator?

There is a charismatic ideology that leads to symbolic capital, misrecognition of other types of capital. It directs attention at the apparent producer rather than looking at the field as a whole.

We know there is someone who creates the creator, a critic or other who discovers a person and legitimates them. A publisher is a part of this.  

What makes reputations is not institutional persons or anything - it i sthe field of production, the systme of objective relations between agents or institutions in which the value of works of art and belief in that value are continously generate.

Modern art exposes the mockery of art itself, .


There is collective misrecognition - in which every9one decides that someone has power and whatever they do is meaninful.

We have creators, we have establishment sand we have challengers, but they are all sanctioned or subsumed by the field.

Critics also take different approaches in the field, and use language to identify winners and losers, pllaying another part of teh field.   

And really all of this is only sincere when there is a  perfect match between the position in the field and the dispositions of the occupant.

>It is impossible to u􀙙e erstand how dispositions come to be adjusted to positions (so that t journalist is adjusted to his newspaper and consequently to that
aper's readership, and the readers are adjusted to. the paper and so to
;he journalist) unless one IS aware that the objectIve structures of the
field of production give rise to categories of perception which structure
the perception and appreciation of its products. p.95

In the long run, again, all cultuarl business becomes commercial business. So people have risky long term investments and safe short term investments

# Chapter 3 - The Market of Symbolic GOods

## The Logic of the Process of Autonomization
How do things become autonomized? We see a lot of autonomization happening. For one, there is a growht of consumers of increasing diversity. There are also more and more diverse producer. There is also a mulptlication of agencies o consecreation, such as academics, salons, critics etc.

New producers and consumers, then, help to recreate art in new directions which gives it a sense of autonomy.

There is also a market that is larger and thus more impersonal.
But the liberty is also part of their submission.

## Field of Restricted Production
There is  large-scale and small scale production of art. I feel like this has been covered already.

I"m going to mov every9one

# Chapter 5 - Field of Power, Literary Field and Habitus

I did not read the first chapter of this section and am hoping it is ok. It is about

>The literary field (one may also speak of the artistic field, the philosophical
f,eld, etc.) is an independent social universe with its own laws of
functioning, its specific relations of force, its dominants and its domihntaeted,
and so forth. Put another way, to speak of 'field' is to recall that p rary works are produced in a particular social universe endowed with articular institutions and obeying specific laws. And yet this observation
runs counter to both the tradition of internal reading, which  p.86

This is all really repetitive I feel. I Am done with this for now.
