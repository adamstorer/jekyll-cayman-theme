Abstract: "This article describes how people adapt to new roles by experimenting with provisional selves that serve as trials for possible but not yet fully elaborated professional identities. Qualitative data collected from professionals in transition to more senior roles reveal that adaptation in- volves three basic tasks (1) observing role models to identify potential identities, (2) experimenting with provi- sional selves, and (3) evaluating experiments against in- ternal standards and external feedback. Choices within tasks are guided by an evolving repertory that includes images about the kind of professional one might become and the styles, skills, attitudes, and routines available to the person for constructing those identities. A conceptual framework is proposed in which individual and situ- ational factors influence adaptation behaviors indirectly by shaping the repertory of possibilities that guides self- construction."

>This article describes how people adapt to new roles by experimenting with provisional selves that serve as trials for possible but not yet fully elaborated professional identities. Qualitative data collected from professionals in transition to more senior roles reveal that adaptation in- volves three basic tasks: (1) observing role models to identify potential identities, (2) experimenting with provi- sional selves, and (3) evaluating experiments against in- ternal standards and external feedback. Choices within tasks are guided by an evolving repertory that includes images about the kind of professional one might become and the styles, skills, attitudes, and routines available to the person for constructing those identities. A conceptual framework is proposed in which individual and situ- ational factors influence adaptation behaviors indirectly by shaping the repertory of possibilities that guides self- construction.

This is about the socialization of newcomers as consultants and investment bankers

<def>Professional Identity: the relatively stable and enduring constellation of attributes, beliefs, values, motives and experiences in terms of which people define themselves in a professional role.</def>


>Despite consensus in the socialization literature that identity changes accompany work role changes, the process by which identity evolves remains underexplained. In this article I argue that people adapt to new professional roles by ex- perimenting with images that serve as trials for possible but not yet fully elaborated professional identities. These "provi- sional selves" are temporary solutions people use to bridge the gap between their current capacities and self-concep- tions and the representations they hold about what attitudes and behaviors are expected in the new role.

The question here is, we realize that people have organizational-specific notions of role, but do we have a bleed in to other notions of identity?

>But although situations impose demands and suggest models, people interpret and act on these subjec- tively, as a function of their self-conceptions-who they are and would like to be in the future (Markus and Nurius, 1986). The literature to date, however, has paid scant attention to the role played by self-conceptions during socialization, in particular, how images of desired future selves serve as catalysts for identity development. p.4

That is, in the story we tell about our possible selves, we choose who we want to be, what type of person we are.

You do role prototyping, what is this role, who is this role, and then you see if you fit within them.

There is also experimenting through imitation strategies and true-to-self strategies.
