# Introduction - The Problem of the Sociology of Knowledge
>How much we owe to the late Alfred Schutz will become
clear in various parts of the following treatise. However, we
would like to acknowledge here the influence of Schutz's
teaching and writing on our thinking. p.13

The question is, how deeply do we question what is real? We cannot take reality at face value since we see quickly that other individuals have different realities. On the other hand, philosophers take nothing for granted. So where are we?

We work to understand how a common base of knowledge comes about.

>the immediate intellectual antecedents of the
sociology of knowledge are three developments in nineteenthcentury
German thought - the Marxian, the Nietzschean, and
the historicist p.17

Marx - Man's consciousness is determiend by his social being. Also the substructure/superstruction.
<def>B and Ls take on Marxs substructure superstructure: What concerned Marx was that human thought is founded in human activity (labour, in the widest sense of the word) and in the social relations brought about by this activity. Substructure and superstructure are best understood if one views them as, respectively, human activity and the world produced by that activity. </def>

<def>B and Ls take on Nietzsches contribution to soc of knowledge: There is a general negative mood, and sohows additional perspectives on the struggle for survival and power. Knowledge is constructed for reasons, in order to deceive others and oneself. Nietzsche provides the mood. </def>

<def>B and Ls take on historicisims contribution to soc of knowledge: The immediate predecessor of the sociology of knowledge. An overwhelming sense of the relativity of all perspectives on human events. Predisposed soc of knowledge towards a strong interest in history and the employment of an essentially historical method. </def>

Mannheim followed this tradition in the sociology of knowledge:
>Society was here seen as determining not only the
appearance but also the content of human ideation, with the
exception of mathematics and at least parts of the natural
sciences. The sociology of knowledge thus became a positive
method for the study of almost any facet of human thought.
Significantly, Mannheim's key concern was with the
phenomenon of ideology. He distinguished between the particular,
the total and the general concepts of ideology - ideology
as constituting only a segment of an opponent's thought;
ideology as constituting the whole of an opponent's thought
(similar to Marx's 'false consciousness'); and (here, as Mannheim
thought, going beyond Marx) ideology as characteristic
not only of an opponent's but of one's own thought as well. p.21

Mannheim thought that knowledge must always be knowledge froma  certain position.

>The logical structure of this trouble is
basically the same in all cases: How can I be sure, say, of my
sociological analysts of American middle-class mores in view of
the fact that the categories I use for this analysis are conditioned
by historically relative forms of thought, that I myself
and everything I think is determined by my genes and by my
ingrown hostility to my fellowmen, and that, to cap it all, I
am myself a member of the American middle class?

But we can't bother too much with these questions, we must continue with the empirical sciece.

>The theoretical formulations of reality, whether
they be scientific or philosophical or even mythological, do not
exhaust what is 'real' for the members of a society. Since this
is so, the sociology of knowledge must first of all concern itself
with what people 'know' as 'reality' in their everyday, non- or
pre-theoretical lives. In other words, common-sense 'knowledge'
rather than 'ideas' must be the central focus for the
sociology of knowledge. It is precisely this 'knowledge' that
constitutes the fabric of meanings without which no society
could exist. p.27

## Chapter 1 - The Foundations of Knowledge in Everyday Life

>Ours
is thus an enterprise that, although theoretical in character, is
geared to the understanding of a reality that forms the subject
matter of the empirical science of sociology, that is, the world
of everyday life. p.33

It's hard to get away form philosophy when doing this. How given is our relaity? What are teh foundations of knowledge in everyday life? What is the intersubjective common sense in everyday life?

To do this we have to stop ourselves from making assertions about the "ontological status of the phonemena analyzed" Why? I'm not sure, but it has something to do with individuals taken-for-granted character of things?

So we begin with consciousness.
1. Consciousness
Consciousness is always intentional
Consciousness intends or is directed towards objects.
We are only conscious of things.


2. Objects
Different objects appear to consciousness as parts of different spheres of reality.

Because we dream, and see dreams as objects, and we have internal ideas and see these as objects, we also see these are in different spheres of reality. Therefore, our consciousness can make sense of different spheres of reality.

Everyday life is the main reality.

>position entitles it to the designation of paramount
reality. The tension of consciousness is highest in
everyday life, that is, the latter imposes itself upon consciousness
in the most massive, urgent and intense manner. It is
impossible to ignore, difficult even to weaken in its imperative
.presence. Consequently, it forces me to be attentive to it in
the fullest way. p.35

We order the objects in someway. The reality of every day life seems clear. The objects we see in reality have been constituted as objects by others in reality. We know of a large world but we also know of the objects closest to us that we can manipulate.  

In our immediate world, our consciousness makes sense of objects pragmatically. My attention is mainly determined by waht I am doing, have done or plan to do.

That is, there is some world that we are tied to.

We have some common sense knowledge that I share with others. There is an ongoing correspondence between my meanings and their meanings in this world. There is a common sense about the reality.


But the continuity of this reality can be problematized. As people do things that are outside of our understanding, we must make an effort to understand what they are doing or to understand why they are doing crazy things.

THere is some temporality to consciousness. Time is intersubjectively understood by all people more or less. Time is finite for me because death is inevitable.

>Only within this temporal structure does
everyday life retain for me its accent of reality. Thus in cases
where I may be 'disoriented' for one reason or another (say, I
have been in an automobile accident in which I was knocked
unconscious), I feel an almost instinctive urge to 'reorient'
myself within the temporal structure of everyday life. I look
at my watch and try to recall what day it is. By these acts alone
I re-enter the reality of everyday life. p.42

What is a good summary of this chapter? People have consciousness directed at objects, the objects exist intersubjectively, and seem to have a specific time and place associated with them. We have special relationships with time and place, ourselves, and the objects around us.

# Social Interaction in Everyday Life

Everyday life is shared with others! Face to foace social interaction is fully real inthat it is not at all remote. But everything other than face adn face is more and more remote.

People become real when I interact with them, and I know myself better no matter what. But knowing myself requires more reflection.

>For instance, I may view
the other as someone inherently unfriendly to me and act
towards him within a pattern of'unfriendly relations' as understood
by me. In the face-to-face situation, however, the other
may confront me with attitudes and acts that contradict this
pattern, perhaps up to a point where I am led to abandon the
pattern as inapplicable and to view him as friendly. In other
words, the pattern cannot sustain the massive evidence of the
other's subjectivity that is available to me in the face-to-face
situation. By contrast, it is much easier for me to ignore such
evidence as long as I do not encounter the other face to face. p.44


There are also modes of understanding others, and these are called "typificatory schemes"
That is, they are  a man, a european, a smart.

There are continuums of typifications that varay with respect to how close we are to a person.

>At one pole of the continuum are those
others with whom I frequently and intensively interact in
face-to-face situations - my 'inner circle', as it were. At the
other pole are highly anonymous abstractions, which by their
very nature can never be available in face-to-face interaction.
Social structure is the sum total of these typifications and of
the recurrent patterns of interaction established by means of
them. As such, social structure is an essential element of the
reality of everyday life. p.48

This seems like a pretty big stretch to me, but could be just as believable as anything else.

# Language and Knowledge in Everyday Life

People express themselves in the world. People make things and this is called "objectivation"

There is a special type of objectivation called signification. Signs are meant to serve as an index of subjective meanings. Language is the most important sign system, of signification of human subjectivities.

Language is an important part in understanding everyday life.

>Put differently, language is
pliantly expansive so as to allow me to objectify a great variety
of experiences coming my way in the course of my life. Language
also typifies experiences, allowing me to subsume them
under broad categories in terms of which they have meaning
not only to myself but also to my fellowmen. As it typifies, it
also anonymizes experiences, for the typified experience can,
in principle, be duplicated by anyone falling into the category
in question.


This is full circle so far.
We express ourselves to others in language.
We use language to typify experiences.
We interact with others through language, by expressing ourselves.
We identify each other through typifying processes.
We anonymize our experiences to make sense of the world.

We can also produce counter examples or imaginary examples and language allows us to do this.

Our typifications make up different semantic fields which allow us to process our own thoughts.

But remember, everyday life is dominated by pragmatic motives.
>knowledge limited to pragmati􀂓
competence in routine performances, occupies a prominent
place in the social stock of knowledge. For example, I use the
telephone every day for specific pragmatic purposes of my
own. I know how to do this p.56

And then we talk about the common sense reality of life that comes from Schutz. We know things about every day life structured around what we know. Common sense knowledge is socially distributed, and we decide who gets what knowledge based on some logic..


# Part Two - Society As Objective Reality

## Institutionaliztion

>Man's instinctual organization may be described as underdeveloped,
compared with that of the other higher mammals.
Man does have drives, of course. But these drives are highly
unspecialized and undirected. This means that the human
organism is capable of applying its constitutionally given
equipment to a very wide and, in addition, constantly variable
and varying range of activities. p.66

Humans are very platic in terms of how they determine typifications. For instance, sexuality seems to be quite pliable.

>The formation of the self, then, must also be understood in
relation to both the ongoing organismic development and the
social process in which the natural . and the human environment
are mediated through the significant others.1 p.68

We become a self at the same time our bodies grow to adulthod, but we distinguish between the two. But the self production is a social enterprise.

So how does a social order arise? There is no right way, nothing about it other htan human activity.

>To ?Dderstand the causes, other than those posited by the
btologt􀂜al. constants, for the emergence, maintenance and
transmission of a social order one must undertake an analysis
that eventuates in a theory of institutionalization p.70

### Origins of Institutionalization
Human activity is habituated. Habitualization is the act of repeating an action until it becomes a pattern that can be reproduced with less effort.

>Habitualized actions, of course, retain their meaningful
character for the individual although the meanings involved
become embedded as routines in his general stock of knowledge,
taken for granted by him and at hand for his projects
into the future p.71

It also makes it easier to make sense of the social world.

So here's how it works:
1. Action is habituated by different actors doing something together.
2. These actions are typficiactions that are available to many doing or not doign the action.
3. The institution, then, is the abstracted typification of habituated action, so that X action will be performed by Y person.

Insititutions are created by historical cirumstance withs ome focus on control.

>To say that a segment of
human activity has been institutionalized is already to say
that this segment of human activity has been subsumed under
social control. Additional control mechanisms are required
only in so far as the processes of institutionalization are less
than completely successful. Thus, fo r instance, the law may
provide that anyone who breaks the incest taboo will have his
head chopped off. This provision may be necessary because
there have been cases when individuals offended against the
taboo. It is unlikely that this sanction will have to be invoked
cqntinuously (unless the institution delineate􀂵 by the incest
taboo is itself in the course of disintegration, a special case
that we need not elaborate here). It makes little ::.ense, therefo
re, to say that human sexuality is socially controlled by
beheading certain individuals. Rather, human sexuality is
socially controlled by its institutionalization in the course of
the particular history in question. One may add, of course,
that the incest taboo itself is nothing but the negative side of
an assemblage of typifications, which define in the first place
which sexual conduct is incestuous and which is not. p.73

Existing within an institutionalized world makes it easier to predict action.

Those actions which are most likely to turn into institutions are those which provide some common sense motive to multiple individuals in a regular manner. The more people are there, the more formal rules become layed out in some sort of crystallized way.

As a child, you are socialized to take some typifications and x for granted.

This produces a funny little circle:
>It
is already possible, however, to see the fundamental relationship
of these three dialectical moments in social reality. Each
of them corresponds to an essential characterization of the
social world. Society is a human product. Society is an objective
reality. Man is a social product. It may also already be evident
that an analysis of the social world that leaves out any one of
these three moments will be distortive. 29 One may further add
that only with the transmission of the social world to a new
generation (that is, internalization as effectuated in socialization)
does the fundamental social dialectic appear in its totality.
To repeat, only with the appearance of a new generation can
one properly speak of a social world. p.79

The three types of dialectical momentsare - society is human, society is object, man is social.

We need our institutions to be integrated with one another so that individuals can make sense of their life history as meaningful in some way. This is separate from some sort of larger theoretical notion of how you should work, or some moral construct. This is like, what a utopia would look like. Our institutions constructed and integrated based on a theoretical system.  


## Sedimentation and Tradition

People don't think about things, stuff becomes habituated and turns into traditition. Things happen and they become objectivated in signs (like in a story) and then they become part of some tradition, part of some common thought.

>Since human beings are frequently sluggish and forgetful,
there must also be procedures by which these meanings can be
reimpressed and rememorized, if necessary by coercive and
generally unpleasant means. Furthermore, since human beings
are frequently stupid, instituticnal meanings tend to
become simplified in the process of transmission, so that the
given collection of institutional 'formulae' can be readily
learned and memorized by successive generations p.87

There is no functionality or consistency in these traditions, institutions, etc. We just do stuff..

## Roles

Institional order comes from the typificiation of roles, so that actors can move between rolse and make sense of everything. This is really a social self, the self that takes on certain roles.

>We can properly begin to speak of roles when this kind of
typification occurs in the context of an objectified stock of
knowledge common to a collectivity of actors. Roles are types
of actors in such a context.37 It can readily be seen that the
construction of role typologies is a necessary correlate of the
institutionalization of conduct. Institutions are embodied in
individual experience by means of roles. p.91


Roles arise in the same way as institutions. Roles represent the instituional order.


## Scope and Modes of Institutionalization

Not everything is institutionalized. The question is, how general are the social problems/structures that people come into contact with regularly. Insititutions may also diminish


I guess the thing is, institutions really are very broad.

>Another consequence of institutional segmentation is the
possibility of socially segregated sub-universes of meaning.
These result from accentuations of role specialization to the
point where role-specific knowledge becomes altogether esoteric
as against the common stock of knowledge. Such subuniverses
of meaning may or may not be submerged from the
common view. p.102

People might claim control over these sub universes. This is WEber technical knowledge, bureaucracy.


To what extent is human action understood as non-human. That is, to what extent are things reified: To treat human phenomena as non-human or supra-human. For instance, the reification of roles may bring the person closer to their own aspects of themselves. your identity ven mayb e reified by yourselfor others.


# Legitimation

Legitimation isa second order process, produces new meaning that integrate disparate institutional processes.

One must prove that an institiution or institituional order is legitimate to its members practically, and also subjectively meaningful to each individual.

People do shit, it becomes the way things are done, and then people work to make sure this method is seeen as legitimate. You are told why one should do something and why things are what they ar.e

There are different levels of legitimation.
1. INcipient Legitimation - De facto explanations. You learn that someone is a cousin and you say, ok, this is how things are done.
2. Rudimentary Explanations - Proverbs, moral maxims, and other simple rules of thumb for explaining why things are done in a certain way, or a deeper understanding of how things are.
3. Explicit Theories - Comprehensive explanations of how things work.
4. Symbolic Universes - Bodies of theoretical tradition that integrate different sections of meaning into a totality.

>The symbolic universe is conceived of as the matrix of all
socially objectivated and subjectively real meanings ; the entire
historic society and the entire biography of the individual are
seen as events taking place within this. universe. What is particularly
important, the marginal situations of the life of the
individual (marginal, that is, in not being included in the
reality of everyday existence in society) are also encompassed
by the symbolic universe. p.114

These are religions that provide deep explanations of how thigns should work. The sybmolic universe assigns status and orders history.

There is more on the symbolic universe that I think I'm not goign to delve real deep into at the moment, but could be worth coming back to. The problem is that the symbolic universe is something separate from people that does not necessarily hold people so strongly. It's clear though that symbolic universes are also things like dictatorship, capitalism, communism, etc. which cannot abide other ways of doing things and have a stake in doing things a specific way.


# Society as Subjective Reality

## Internalization of Reality

Remember, socety is:
>an ongoing dialectical process composed of the three
moments of externalization, objectivation and internalization. p.149

Individuals externalize their own being in to the social world, internalize it as objective reality. This is a dialectic.

People exist socially and communicate though are not necessarily comletely understood.

The meaning people make is from others.

>in the complex form of internalization, I
not only 'understand' the other's momentary subjective processes,
I 'understand' the world in which he lives, and that
world becomes my own. This presupposes that he and I share
time in a more than ephemeral way and a comprehensive perspective,
which links sequences of situations together intersubjectively.
We now not only understand each other's
definitions of shared situations, we define them reciprocally.
A nexus of motivations is established between us and extends
into the future. Most importantly, there is now an ongoing
mutual identification between us. We not only live in the same
world, we participate in each other's being. p.150

Once this happens, we are members of a society.

This is brought about by socialization, which is:
<def>What is socialization?: The comprehensive and consistent induction of an individual into the objective world of a society or a sector of it.</def>

There is primary socialization in childhood, and secondary socialization afterwards. Primary socialization is more important. People make sense of the world through the filters of significant others as well as objective social structure.

>In other words, the self
is a reflected entity, reflecting the attitudes first taken by
significant others towards it ;6 the individual becomes what he
is addressed as by his significant others. This is not a onesided,
mechanistic process. It entails a dialectic between
identification by others and self-identification, between objectively
assigned and subjectively appropriated identity. The
dialectic, which is present each moment the individual identifies
with his significant others, is, as it were, the particularization
in individual life of the general dialectic of society that has
already been discussed. p.152

And the identity you have is a product of and part of the social world tha tyou inhabit.


Where are belief structures?
>Primary socialization ends when the concept of the generalized
other (and all that goes with it) has been established in the
consciousness of the individual. At this point he is an effective
member of society and in subjective possession of a self and a
world. But this internalization of society, identity and reality
is not a matter of once and for all. p.157

## Secondary Socialization

WE would have only primary socialization if you could get all of knowledge into people's minds before their adults.

Secondary socialization is the internalization of sub-worlds of knowledge based on some subsection of insititutions. That is, this is something like a professional identity.

## Maintenance and Transformation of Subjective Reality

The content that people internalize from society is under constant threat. Society needs to maintain symmetry in order for the world to not fall apart.

Primary socialization creates an inevitable reality. Secondary socialization with its context specific knewledge. This reality is less deeply rooted.

People do two types of reality maintenance.
1. Routine Maintenance - Embodied routines reaffirm that what we see is real in our eyes. We see people doing things and have our every day life affirmed. Significant others do a lot of this, and insignificant others are a background of reality affirmation.  
2. Crisis Maintenance - Collective rituals after natural disasters may help with this stuff. These are like situations where an alternative reality becomes present.

>At the same time that the conversatio nal apparatus ongoingly
maintains reality, it ongoingly modifies it. Items are
dropped and added, weakening some sectors of what is still
being taken for granted and reinforcing others. Thus the subjective
reality of something that is never talked about comes to
be shaky. p. 173

Everyone wants to steer clear of Belief Structures. Instead people have competing roles that are brought about by routines.


How could  a dismantling of social relations take place?
>A 'recipe' for successful alternation has to include both
social and conceptual conditions, the social, of course, serving
as the matrix of the conceptual. The most important social
condition is the availability of an effective plausibility structure,
that is, a social base serving as the 'laboratory' of transfo
rmation. This plausibility structure will be mediated to the
individual by means of significant others, with whom he must
establish strongly affective identification. No radical transformation
of subjective reality (including, of course, identity)
is possible without such identification, which inevitably replicates
childhood experiences of emotional dependency on
significant others p.177

Religions make alternate realities seem possible, they give the meanings behind it.


## Internalization and Social Structure

Simply existing in a certain social structure tells you who you are (what roles make sense) and everyone knows who they are supposed to be. Other possibilities arise when you see them, and it is abnormal if you identify with stuff outside of your role. The primacy of role in identifying the social world may be right, but it is a little unclear. s

## Theories about Identity

Social structure specifics create identity types based on, say, geography. These are supposedly enduring and identifiable.

>Problems arising
out of the dialectic between either subjective identity and
social identity-assignments, or identity and its biological substratum
(of which more later), can be classified according to
theoretical categories - which is, of course, the presupposition
for any therapy. The psychological theories then serve to
legitimate the identity-maintenance and identity-repair procedures
established in the society, providing the theoretical
linkage between identity and world, as these are both socially
defined and subjectively appropriated p.197

People have roles, roles have attributes, people take on these attributes.

## Organism and Identity.

Your own body also effects identity in some way. You die at some point, and society has some power over that. Man has instincts and biology that must be overcome by social roles and the attributes they put on you.
