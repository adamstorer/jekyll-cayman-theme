What is the relationship between class consciousness and unionization?

>American sociology's study of working-class consciousness has
almost invariably treated class consciousness as workers' conceptions,
images, attitudes, and ideational and verbal responses to the
social arrangements in which they find themselves. The basic approach
has been to develop a survey schedule designed to measure
worker attitudes on a range of issues: class identification, work
satisfaction and dissatisfaction, class animosities, and political preferences.
These attitudes are then correlated with any number of
independent variables, such as skill level, racial or ethnic identification etc. p.4-5

But this is a pretty goofy way of studying class consciousness. For one, opinions might vary over time, and are not necessarily solid states. You might find some evidence of class consciousness in "explosions of consciousness" These are fairly common.

>In Marx's formulation, the working class is "in struggle," "becomes
united," "constitutes itself"; and these activities of "struggling,"
"uniting," and "constituting" ought to be considered processes
of class consciousness. Too often, however, the notion of a
class "in itself" is reduced to an "objective" matter of determining
the relative size of the labor force, the concentration of workers in
various industries, the occupational characteristics of a workforce,
or the level of union membership. Concomitantly, the notion of a
class "for itself" becomes a "subjective" problem of determining to
what extent class members are conceptually aware of a class structure,
whether or not they employ a language of class, or whether
they identify themselves as belonging to one class or another. The
latter has become the problem for most American sociologists.
In Marxist epistemology, "objectivity" and "subjectivity" are conjoined,
not abstracted from each other. p.9

Marx grounded consciousness in life activity, and a class in itself would somewhow be a class for itself. Thus solidatrity is created and expressed in mutual association within the workplace. The workpalce brings workers together and this coming together creates solidarity. FOR MARX. But this is why Marx is wrong.

>Thus the collective activity and mobilization of both workers
and employers take place within a conflictual context and
should not be considered apart from it. As such, class consciousness
essentially represents the cultural expression of the lived experience
of class, an experience shaped by the process of interaction of
these collectivities in opposition to one another p.14

What about culture:
>When conceived of as cultural expression, class consciousness
seems less a matter of disembodied mental attitude than a broader
set of practices and repertoires available for empirical investigation.
On one level, this approach treats culture as the "peculiar and
distinctive way of life of the group or class, the meanings, values
and ideas embodied in institutions, in social relations, in systems of
beliefs, in mores and customs, in the uses of objects and material
life."32 Such "maps of meaning" are not simply ideational, but are
objectivated in social relations, institutions, and practices p.14

This is a clear move from Ann's unsettled times.What does Fantasia want? To pursue a thoeretical approach that views the interstices of dominant cultural pratices. So we look at changed periods but we also look at the different formations of working class groups to try and get at something deeper.

Fantasia focuses on cultures of solidarity to focus on the broad range of cultural practices tied to class struggle.
>I mean a cultural expression that arises within the
wider culture, yet which is emergent in its embodiment of oppositional
practices and meanings. p.17

<def>Why does Fantasia stray away from the in itself/for itself divide: </def>
<def>What does Fantasia replace the concept of class consciousness with?: Cultures of solidarity....</def>

>rather than taking the generalized sense of class consciousness
and attempting to cut the empirical fabric to fit a fully specified
design, I will examine case studies of local cultures of solidarity—
of the lived experience of workers in collective action—to
provide a basis for understanding class capacities at a more generalized
level. p.18

Bureaucratization plays a role here again:
>That is, in the United States a routinized,
bureaucratic system has been imposed to channel conflict and
sharply limit worker solidarity, and "cultures of solidarity" will thus
tend to emerge only when workers or employers circumvent routine
channels and workers seek, or are forced, to rely on their
mutual solidarity as the basis for their power p.19

This is a great example of some of the links between motivation and justification at work and questions some of the roles of values etc.

### Corporate Action and the Bounds of Solidarity

While we want to watch workers to understand more about class struggle, we need to understand both sides of class struggle and put labor history in conversation with management history.

For instance, Ford's $5 a day plan was completely voluntary, but people had to be sober and good fathers etc. In other words, here corporate welfarism is seen as a form of control.

Employers associations often also worked together to deal with srike breaking etc. They also put out anti union propaganda etc.
>it was revealed that employers were
spending $80 million a year for espionage services. Boyer and
Morais have reported on the extraordinary scope of labor espionage
in this period: "230 detective agencies furnished the largest American
corporations with 100,000 spies, who were thought to have
penetrated every one of the country's 48,000 local trade unions."p.44

But unionism continued to spread
>According to one
historical account of the period, CIO offices were being deluged
with phone calls from excited workers shouting: "We've sat down!
Send someone over to organize us!"56 By the end of 1937, the old
AFL had grown by a million new members, and the fledgling CIO's
membership jumped fourfold to 400,000. Industrial unionism was
expanding not because of federal legislation, but as a result of the
successful expression of solidarity and militance by the workers
themselves p.46-7

Post war prosperity made a new social contract where there was less conflict because there was so much money to go around
>Missing the conflictual roots of this new "social contract," analysts
of the workplace in "post-industrial" society focused on a bureaucratization
and routinization held to be characteristic of a "mature"
system of collective bargaining. It was generally argued that
such routinization had supplanted the industrial conflict of an earlier
era, and that theories resting on the importance of class conflict
had consequently become outmoded

BUt perhaps common knowledge was wrong here beause there were more stoppages again in 1970 after a drop off in 50s and 60s. But also the lack of manufacturing jobs just makes wokers less powerful.

## Union Organizing and Collective Interaction

In one hospital, nurses wrote an op edexpressing how much they didn't like how their work was organized in 1972. With union help in the early 1980's nurses started to act more in more in solidarity against the company.

I'm not really sure of how Fantasia is making his case here. I think there was a really strong introduction but I'm not sure I"m really seeing the follow through.

>For some of the organizing committee members, support for the
union had its source in family histories and the value systems in
which they had been reared. One forty-six-year-old housekeeping
worker evaluated the administration's tales about union violence
with reference to her father's experience as a union carpenter:
"They were mentioning about tires being slashed and things like
this when you're associated with 1199. . . . But that's what you
hear about any union, and my father belonged to a union and they
never slashed tires p.161

I'm actually not really sure how this fits with our ideas about the spread of culture or the makeup of individual ideas.

>Working conditions deteriorated,
accelerating the normal rate of job attrition, so that at the time of
the bargaining order, only a small handful of activists remained.
Although they had been bitter about management's ability to tie up
their legal status as a union for so long, some members of the
original organizing committee had actually maintained the group in
relatively strong condition for three years after the election. The
bonds established through the organizing drive endured throughout
that period, and the workers continued to share information
and provide mutual support. p.169

The idea is that in organizing the social relations change.

>revolves around the issue of rationality. Do the participants in such
actions or movements proceed in a rational way, assessing the costs
and benefits of their own participation? In the case above, were the
"demonstrations" of the organizing committee "data" from which
participants took an "accounting" in order to assess the value of
their personal participation as well as the efficacy of the union drive
itself?...the union drive was not simply a matter of a conscious
strategy being set out and followed point by point on a clear field.
At Springfield Hospital the field was littered with many obstacles,
and even had a mine or two strategically planted. With the union
drive taking place in a highly conflictual context, one important
factor was the ability of the combatants to obscure each other's field
of vision, as well as the vision of potential recruits. In such cases,
rational calculation is thus not based on a simple "inventory" of
available resources, but on socially constructed appearances as
well p.171-2

>Not only are decisions made in collective action but also, I would
argue, something new is created in the context of conflict. An
emergent culture is created in which new values are incubated,
new forms of activity generated, and an associational bond of a new
type formed p.174
