## New Preface/Introduction

>It thus becomes essential for the capitalist that control over
the labor process pass from the hands of the worker into his own. This transition
presents itself in history as the progressive alienation of the process of production
from the worker; to the capitalist, it presents itself as the problem of
management. " Hence, under capitalism management is war by other means,
sharing "from the first the characterization which Clausewitz assigned to war;
it is movement in a resistant medium because it involves the control of
refractory masses p.xiv

It seems to me the issue with the overall idea of alienation is that we start with some notion of ideal that has a particular theoretical thrust to it, and then we combine it with things.

## Real Introduction

He used to work in a naval yard!

>However, I repeat that I hope no one draws from this the conclusion that my views are shaped by nostalgia for an age that cannot be recaptured. Rather, my views about work are governed by nostalgia for an age that has not yet come into being, in which, for the worker, the craft satisfaction that arises from conscious and purposeful mastery ofthe labor process will be combined with the marvels ofscience and the ingenuity ofengineering, an age in which everyone will be able to benefit, in some degree, from this combination. p.5

Braverman is making some arguments about alienation that I am having a little bit of a difficult time making sense of. He is critical of people who ask certain questions about alienation as if it is a scientific fact, and is also critical of people who study the subjective feeling of alienation from work itself. Braverman seems to believe there is some limitation between subjective and objective that differnetiaties class in from class for. The same thing happens if we let individuals choose their own class.  I think in the end Braverman is just highlighting that there are two sides to a Marxist story, the objective way things work and the subjective feelings about it.

But there is something called job dissatisfaction, on the subjective end. People are worried about this for a number of reasons, for instance if things are getting too bad maybe we have to worry about workers revolting. As managers redefine work they are only interested in efficiently raising productivity. We can talk, for instance, about flexible work and what's going on here even though it looks like it's supposed to be making things better for the worker:

>They represent a style of management rather than a genuine change in the position of the worker. They are characterized by a studied pretense of worker "participation," a gracious liberality in allowing the worker to adjust a machine, replace a light bulb, move from one fractional job to another, and to have the illusion of making decisions by choosing among fixed and limited alternatives designed by a management which deliberately leaves insignificant matters open to choice. One can best compare this style of management with the marketing strategy followed by those who, having discovered that housewives resent prepared baking mixes and feel guilty when using them, arrange for the removal of the powdered egg and restore to the consumer the thrill of breaking a fresh egg into the mix, thereby creating an "image" of skilled baking, wholesome products, etc.


# Chapter 1
## Labor and Labor Power
<def>What is work for Marx?: When a man works he realizes his will in an object </def>
>But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality. At the end of every labour-process, we get a result that already existed in the imagination of the labourer at its commencement. He not only effects a change of form in the material on which he works, but he also realises a purpose of his own that gives the law to his modus operandi, and to which he must subordinate his will.' p. 31

Man is realizing a PURPOSE, aand that is what makes humankind different from animals. But when you work you cahnge.

>Finally, the human capacity to perform work, which Marx called "labor power," must not be confused with the power of any nonhuman agency, whether natural or man made. Human labor, whether directly exercised or stored in such products as tools, machinery, or domesticated animals, represents the sole resource ofhumanity in confronting nature. Thus for humans in society, labor power is a special category, separate and inexchangeable with any other, simply because it is human. Only one who is the master ofthe labor ofothers will confuse labor power with any other agency for performing a task, because to him, steam, horse, water, or human muscle which turns his mill are viewed as equivalents, as "factors ofproduction. " For individuals who allocate their own labor (or a community which does the same), the difference between using labor power as against any other power is a difference upon which the entire "economy" turns. And from the point of view ofthe species as a whole, this difference is also crucial, since every individual is the proprietor of a portion ofthe total labor power ofthe community, the society, and the species. p.35

Braverman is essentially recapitulating parts of Marx's arguments here. Human's have labour power which is human, human's sell their labor power but not their capacity to labor which is inalienably theirs.   

>The distinctive capacity ofhuman labor power is therefore not its ability to produce a surplus, but rather its intelligent and purposive character, which gives it infinite adaptability and which produces the social and cultural conditions for enlarging its own productivity, so that its surplus product may be continuously enlarged. p.38

But workers do not make their own use of their labor power, the power itself is alienated in this way. The idea is that as capitalists try and extract as much value as they can from labor they take more and more control over the production process and alienate the worker more and more.

# Chapter 2 - Origins of Management
Here there is some repetition I think between Edwards and Braverman. It deals a little more with specific theoretical constructs, but on the whole this chapter is a less detailed version of Braverman.

# Chapter 3 - Division of Labor

There are essentially two divisions of labor. In general in society we divide labor up into different classes. But within a certain job we diide up a task so much that the labor itself is super divided.

>While the social division of labor subdivides society, the detailed division of labor subdivides humans, and while the subdivision ofsociety may enhance the individual and the species, the subdivision ofthe individual, when carried on without regard to human capabilities and needs, is a crime against the person and against humanity. p.51

And we concern ourself with the division of labor within the enterprise by focusing on the labor process.

And the capitalist can and does subidivide the work into different parts, and then subidivides the worker (i.e. only doing one small part of the work over and over again)
>He can now count his gains in a double sense, not only in productivity but in management control, since that which mortally injures the worker is in this case advantageous to him. p.55

Dividing the craft cheapnes its individual parts and makes everything cheaper. This is called Babbage's principle. Money is saved by breaking it down but it also breaks down the meaning for an individual.



This is the point where it kind of breaks down for Marx and where the alienation/labor process questions are a little bit difficult to follow. The economics here is kind of hard to follow. Basically by beginning at a kind of moralistic starting point we come to analysis that views current work in a negative light. For instance, work is something inherently social, and yet we view individuals meaning from work as inherently individual.

>Every step in the labor process is divorced, so far as possible, from special knowledge and training and reduced to simple labor. Meanwhile, the relatively few persons for whom special knowledge and training are reserved are freed so far as possible from the obligations of simple labor. In this way, a structure is given to all labor processes that at its extremes polarizes those whose time is infinitely valuable and those whose time is worth almost nothing. This might even be called the general law ofthe capitalist division of labor. p.58

## Scientific Management - Here we just get a recapitulation of Taylor. Braverman seems like he's kind of anti Edwardshere in terms of what he's arguing.

Here is Braverman's takeaway:
>The conclusions which Taylor drew from the baptism by fire he received
in the Midvale struggle may be summarized as follows: Workers who are
controlled only by general orders and discipline are not adequately controlled,
because they retain their grip on the actual processes of labor. So long as they
control the labor process itself, they will thwart efforts to realize to the full the
potential inherent in their labor power. To change this situation, control over
the labor process must pass into the hands ofmanagement, not only in a formal
sense but by the control and dictation ofeach step ofthe process, including its
mode ofperformance. In pursuit ofthis end, no pains are too great, no efforts
excessive, because the results will repay all efforts and expenses lavished on
this demanding and costly endeavor p.69

<def>Scientific management has three principles, what are they for Braverman: the dissociation of the labor process from the skills of the workers, the separation of conception from execution, capitals use of the monopoly over knowledge to control each step of the labor process and its mode of execution.</def>

## Effects of Scientific Manaagement
>The separation of mental work from manual work reduces, at any given
level ofproduction, the need for workers engaged directly in production, since
it divests them oftime-consuming mental functions and assigns these functions
elsewhere. This is true regardless ofany increase in productivity resulting from
the separation. Should productivity increase as well, the need for manual
workers to produce a given output is further reduced. p.86


>At first glance, the organization of labor according to simplified tasks, conceived and controlled elsewhere, in place of the previous craft forms of labor, have a clearly degrading effect upon the teclmical capacity ofthe worker. In its effects upon the working population as a whole, however, this matter is complicated by the rapid growth of specialized administrative and technical staff work, as well as by the rapid growth of production and the shifting of masses to new industries and within industrial processes to new occupations. p.88

>The destruction of craftsmanship during the period of the rise of scientific management did not go unnoticed by workers. p. 94

## Habituation of the Worker to Capitalism

Basically Braverman is detailing in the next few chapters the transfer or worker to tool of a machine.
