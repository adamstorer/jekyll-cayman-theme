# Chapter 3 - Personality as a System of Social Action

The social components of action described in Chapter 2 work together to form certain system, such as a personality system.

## Motivations

People have certain drives, or innate tendencies to orient action. Need-dispoistions on the other hand relate to those needs that are not innate.

>We will avoid ad hoc hypotheses
about the amount of biologically determined structuring of drives which
would beg the empirical and conceptual questions of the extent and ways in
which structuring is a need-disposition problem. That is, we will not try to
decide in advance how much the structuring of tendencies is innate and how
much it is a function of the structure and situation of action. p.111

Motivation is some combination of the two. When people strive for something it is the combination of the cognitive and cathectic action oriented towards some motivating object.

>Three different types of need-dispositions are chiefly important in the
theory of action: (1) Need-dispositions vis-a-vis the attitudes of and relationships
with social objects (these need-dispositions mediate person-to-person
relationships) ; (2) need-dispositions vis-a-vis the observance of cultural
standards (these need-dispositions are the internalized social values) ; and
(3) role-expectations, which are on a somewhat different level from the other
two.^ p.115

And how can we view the personality system more broadly?
>rather than the observer's), these are
the functional foci of action organization. The over-all problem of personality
systems thus may be viewed in two ways: (1) from the outside, or from the
scientific observer's viewpoint, it is the problem of maintaining a bounded
system; in other words, it is the personality's problem of continuing to be the
kind of system it is. (2) From the inside, or from the actor's viewpoint, it is
the problem of optimization of gratification. p.120


I need to go back and do more on Parsons, but I'm not sure now is the right time. I'm moving on for now.
