Abstract: "The process of leaving deeply meaningful and embodied identities can be experienced as a struggle against addiction, with continuing cognitive, emotional, and physiological responses that are involuntary, unwanted, and triggered by environmental factors. Using data derived from a unique set of in-depth life history interviews with 89 former U.S. white supremacists, as well as theories derived from recent advances in cognitive sociology, we examine how a rejected identity can persist despite a desire to change. Disengagement from white supremacy is characterized by substantial lingering effects that subjects describe as addiction. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of identity residual for understanding how people leave and for theories of the self."

>The process of leaving deeply meaningful and embodied identities can be experienced as a struggle against addiction, with continuing cognitive, emotional, and physiological responses that are involuntary, unwanted, and triggered by environmental factors. Using data derived from a unique set of in-depth life history interviews with 89 former U.S. white supremacists, as well as theories derived from recent advances in cognitive sociology, we examine how a rejected identity can persist despite a desire to change. Disengagement from white supremacy is characterized by substantial lingering effects that subjects describe as addiction. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of identity residual for understanding how people leave and for theories of the self.

Who are white supremacists? What are their individual experieinces?
What happens when you get sucked into a "movement" and then you leave?

The question is - Why do individuals who have already rejected white supremacist ideologies and left the movement have a difficult time shaking their former throughts, feelings, and bodily reactions, and in many cases, come to think of themselves as being addicted to white supremacism?

What is addiction here - Overlapping processes referring to a bundle of characterstics.
>In this
respect, we are less concerned about whether
our subjects are actually addicted to white
supremacy and more concerned with their
descriptions of involuntary and unwanted
thoughts, feelings, bodily responses, and
behavior. p.1168

Conventional wisdom suggests they are consumed by hate, and change seems unlikely.

But waht of the burn-out rate of memebers of these groups? And the retention efforts initiated?

>Many treatments of identity
change focus on either the stages of transformation
(Athens 1995; Ebaugh 1988;
Prochaska et al. 1991) or the conscious, intentional
dimensions of self-change (Giordano,
Cernkovich, and Rudolph 2002; Kiecolt 1994).
Less is known, however, about the neurocognitive
dynamics related to involuntary and
unwanted aspects of identity residual. Identities
are constructed and performed through
situational occasions, so when situations are
routinized, insular, and involve extreme hatred,
the persistence of these identities may be much
greater than previously thought. p.1168

## Disengagement, Residual

Disengagmenet could be the physical and psychological withdrawal from particular identities or roles.

So, do identities have more residual than others? They use DiMaggio's typology of cognition.

But really we want to hink about social processes as having addictive qualities - for instance, social processes that turn on dopamine receptors.

We must think about how an identity may cut across multiple dimensions.roles, and in these cases disengagement from that identity may involve residual.

From cognitive sociology we have dual process (fast and slow) and emotion (hot - emotional cold - not emotional)

DiMaggio constrains hot-cold and deliberate-automatic.

>Hot and
automatic cognition related to a strong ideology
are especially important for understanding
potential similarities between addiction
and the persistence of a rejected identity p.1170

One must also think of the strngth of an ideology - which has two factors:
1. How large is the portion of a person's life that the ideology is salient to
2. Does the ideology typologize people in a hot way. This means things will be hot and quick.

Habits are durable, genderalized dispositions.
Addiction, on the other hand - is thoughts, emotions, bodily esperiences, and unwanted bheavior of a choronic, relapsing, or compulsive nature. That is hot-bad habits.

## Methods and Finding

They did interviews using snowball sampling.

The finding is that hate is totalizing. It can come to be a part of many aspects of yoru thought. That is, the scheme becomes deep and forces you to think in a certain way.

People often see hating as an addiction, or see themselves as relapsing into more hate.

These relapses or residuals can be momentary flashes, or a situational relapse.

People do self-talk strategies to resist rsiduals. And then you need to shift from automatic to residual cognition.

## Self-Talk Strategies to Resist Residual

HOw does resistance to these residuals work? We have agentic motives where people try to stop themselves from thinkign the thoughts they don'tw ant ot think.

Self-talk is a way to have DELIBERATE cognition that can be hot or cold. People essentially do cognitive behavioral therapy.


>For Darren, learning new ways to
act requires reminders that his past self need
not be his current or future self. It is not simply
a matter of changing his ideas or acting in
new ways. He had to remember that he was
“not that guy anymore” through repeated selfcoaching. p. 1180

For others though, they need to look for another cross cutting identity.
