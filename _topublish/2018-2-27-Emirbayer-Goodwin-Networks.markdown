Abstract: "Network analysis is one of the most promising currents in sociological research, and yet it has never been subjected to a theoretically informed assessment and critique. This article outlines the theoretical presuppositions of network analysis. It also distinguishes between three different (implicit) models in the network literature of the interrelations of social structure, culture, and human agency. It concludes that only a strategy for historical explanation that synthesizes social structural and cultural analysis can adequately explain the formation, reproduction, and transformation of networks themselves. The article sketches the broad contours of such a theoretical synthesis in the conclusion."

>Network analysis is one of the most promising currents in sociological research, and yet it has never been subjected to a theoretically informed assessment and critique. This article outlines the theoretical presuppositions of network analysis. It also distinguishes between three different (implicit) models in the network literature of the interrelations of social structure, culture, and human agency. It concludes that only a strategy for historical explanation that synthesizes social structural and cultural analysis can adequately explain the formation, reproduction, and transformation of networks themselves.

>There has been an unfortunate lack of interest in situating network analysis within the broader traditions of sociological theory, much less in undertaking a systematic inquiry into its underlying strengths and weaknesses p. 1412

There is a sympathetic critique of the network perspective - it does not think enough about human agency or culture. THere are three models. While each new model offers a way of describing social interaction, it does not explain the formation, reproduction, and transformation of social networks.

# Analyzing Social Networks

## Relations over Categories

Network analysis is all about the imporance of relations. This is an implicit assumption, the anticategorical imperative.
<def>anticatgorical imperative: the implicit point of departure in network analysis, rejecting attempts to explain human behavior or social processes solely in terms of the categorical attributes of actors</def>
<def>formalistic sociology: one that directs attention exclusively to the overall structure of network ties while suppressing consideration of their substantive content. An important driving aspect of network theory.</def>
<def>normative integration: a component of structural-functionalism which focuses on the notion that all people believe the same thing.</def>

But people do like some parts of functionalist notions, such as role, role set and status, though these are reconceptualized.

>Finally, network analysis departs in important ways from the "main- stream" sociological approach to empirical "quantitative" research. As both James Coleman and Andrew Abbott have observed, American soci- ology before the "watershed" moment of the 1940s was marked by a proliferation of qualitative community studies, influenced in large part by the Chicago school and, ultimately, by the writings of Robert Park (Park, Burgess, and McKenzie 1967), W. I. Thomas (1966), and Georg Simmel (1955). These theorists regarded social facts as ecologically em- bedded within specific contexts of time and space - that is to say, within particular interactional fields composed of concrete, historically specific "natural areas" and "natural histories." p.1416

Netowrk analysis departs from the quantitative element of only individualistic study by reverting back to a quantitative approach to the contextual determination of interactional fields etc.

Network analysis is more general because it deals with different kinds of group and different relations, and it is concreted because it disaggregates the elements of their relations.

>More specifically, the net- work approach investigates the constraining and enabling dimensions of patterned relationships among social actors within a system. It is 'this emphasis, in fact, that provides the link between its theoretical insights and its key contributions to empirical research. What network analysis provides, in particular, is a way of avoiding the pitfalls of what Arthur Stinchcombe terms "epochal interpretations" (or, more memorably, "ep- ochal garbage"); that is, of causal explanations that proceed by "using the apparent causal structure created by narrative of a sequence of events to create the illusion that epochal theories are being substantiated" p.1418-9


## Relational Anaalysis as a Way of Representing Social Structure

We think of how networks constrain and enable different types of social behavior.
1. Relational/Social Cohesion - direct and indirect connections among actors.

>Relational analyses, however, also demonstrate that "weak" ties indirectly connecting individuals or bridging the "struc- tural holes" between isolated social groups may be crucial for many important social processes, such as locating employment opportunities p.1419

WE must think of networks as such and understand their makeup, but also the multiplexity of networks.

## Positional Analysis

Instead of relational, positional is another option. THis is meant to think about structural equivalence. By understanding people's positions within a network you can understand more about them than their categories perhaps.

### Three Models of Historical Explanation

1. Relational approaches emphasize mapping typical relations.
2. Structuralist/Positional approaches use relational data to understand the importance of certain roles.

Each aproach has issues.
1. Structuralist determinism - neglects the potentail causal role of actors' beliefs, values, etc. It also neglects teh historical configurations of actions that shape social structure. (Network Structures broadly)
>White's research includes studies of network data describing structural changes over time (White et al. 1976, pp. 763-68); each of these studies, however (like that of Rosenthal et al.), ultimately culminates in a succession of static represen- tations of social structure. Each manages, that is to say, to generate "no models of processes over time."

2. Structural instrumentalism - They accept the prominent role of actors, but conceptualize their activity too narrowly. (Granovetter's Strength of Weak Ties)

>This perspective certainly takes the his- torical role of social actors very carefully into account. However, it also draws implicitly upon "residual categories" from outside its own concep- tual framework-in particular, a model of homo economicus-for ex- plaining the formation and transformation of social networks themselves. There is a striking tendency among structuralist instrumentalists, in fact, to "smuggle" conceptions of agency into their investigations, whether overtly or covertly, from the domain of rational choice theory p.1428

>On the side of positional analysis, Peter Bearman (1993), too, adopts the perspective of structuralist instrumentalism. Bearman tells the story of changing elite social relations in England during the "long sixteenth century" by means of a sequence of blockmodel representations of elite social structure. By examining these blockmodels, he specifies "the slow and arduous process by which religious heterodoxy was embedded in the fabric of local elite social and political life," the tangible mechanisms "by which local elites came to perceive themselves and others as actors whose activity was of religious significance" (Bearman 1993, pp. 171, 132). Bearman's approach is not dissimilar to what Max Weber (1949) long ago termed the analysis of "elective affinity"-the study of how particular discourses and cultural formations come to find a "match" and to "resonate" with specific historically embedded actors. p..1430

3. Structuralist constructionism - This thematizes provocatively the process of identity conversion and robust action in networks, but still does not make enough of culture and agency (Pagett and Ansell on the Medici)

>On the side of positional analysis using blockmodeling techniques, Padgett
and Ansell's (1993) work on the Florentine Renaissance serves as a
useful example of innovative research on networks, culture, and agency.
Padgett and Ansell employ two important theoretical ideas to help explain
the rise of the Medici family in early 15th-century Florence: "structural
channeling of learning" and "robust action." All of the major
figures in their account, they argue, were highly active and dynamic
players. Cosimo de' Medici, for example, steered his family from a position
of abject defeat in Florentine politics to one of near-total ascendancy
during a period of no more than 40 years. And yet, claim Padgett and
Ansell, Cosimo did not pursue from start to finish some omniscient
"grand strategy"; rather, he shrewdly and opportunistically took advantage
of the local "openings" that a succession of exogenous events had
fortuitously brought his way p.1433

# Rethinking the Problem of Agency

Harrison White provides some notion fo a new way

>In Identity
and Control (1992), he suggests that "agency is the dynamic face of
networks," agency understood not only as a "by-product of control,"
but also as "ways of . . . upend[ing] institution[s] and . . . initiat[ing]
fresh action" (White 1992, pp. 315, 245). Significantly-and perhaps
surprisingly, given his earlier anticulturalist bias-White includes a theory
of cultural symbols and discourses in this new version of his social
theory; he now takes discursive "narratives" and "stories" to be among
the key features of social life. "Social networks," he asserts, "are phenomenological
realities, as well as measurement constructs. Stories describe
the ties in networks. . . A social network is a network of meanings"
(White 1992, pp. 65, 67) p. 1437

Identity plays a new role:
1. Identity as primoridal urge to secure footing in a confusing world.
2. A social face, actor in a role.
3. Identity from frictions and errors in different settings
4. Identity as more ro less coherent acounts

But White misses two things.
1. Why do actors engage in control attempts? Primordial is not good enough.
2. What about cultural idioms and conrmative commitments in shaping identites and aspirations?

White thinks of culture as secondary, but they are also atonymous and provide a kind of nonmaterial structure. It is important to remember that cultural formations can enbale actors...People are in a cultural environment.

## Human Agency and Social Action

Analytic autonomy of cultural formations is important, but so is the concrete interrelationship with other network structures and wit the social actors that reproduce and transform them.

>There moreover remains the question as to how structures of all types
-cultural as well as societal-interrelate with social action itself and
with the very potential for human agency. p.1442

>The "identification
of actor and agency," writes Jeffrey Alexander, renders one "guilty
of [the fallacy of] misplaced concreteness. Rather than replacing or reinterpreting
the familiar dichotomy between actors and structures, [this]
identification . . . actually reproduces it in another form. . . . Actors per
se are much more than, and [simultaneously] much less than, 'agents'
[alone]" (Alexander 1992, pp. 1-2; see also Alexander 1988a). Empirical
action, then, is multiply determined. It is not driven exclusively by human
agency, but rather is deeply structured as well by several other
"environments" of action (to use Alexander's terminology), such as the
societal (network) and cultural environments p.1443


>Here we suggest that it is precisely through empirical social action-
multiply determined, and undertaken by concretely situated historical
actors-that these various analytical environments relate to one
another. The several environments of action ought never to be reified as
separate, concrete entities, much less hierarchized as if one of them (social
networks) were always more causally significant than the others.
Two crucial implications follow immediately and directly from these
remarks. One is the notion that historical actors' very identities, goals,
and aspirations are themselves fundamentally constructed phenomena...Of course, if cultural and societal (network) structures shape actors,
then it is equally true that actors shape these structures in turn. Cultural
and social structures do not, in other words, by themselves bring about or
somehow "cause" historical change. Rather, it is the actions of historical
subjects that actually "reconfigure" (given historically conducive circumstances)
existing, long-term structures of action, both cultural and societal
(Sewell 1992b, p. 46). Hence the second implication of our earlier remarks:
namely, that for a more comprehensive understanding of processes
of change, it is necessary to devote more attention not only to the
structural levels of causation, but also to those more ephemeral dynamics
of historical "events," that "relatively rare subclass of happenings" that
transform such structures in "significant" ways p.1444-5
