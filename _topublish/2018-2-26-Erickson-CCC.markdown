Abstract: "Bourdieu's analysis of class and culture errs in neglecting two important aspects of social structure: social networks and class relations at work. He expects high-status culture to be useful in class because it is correlated with class, but culture used at work includes both genres related to class (used in domination) and genres unrelated to class (used in coordination). High-status culture is correlated with class but excluded, not used, in the competitive private sector. The most widely useful cultural resource is cultural variety, and social network variety is a better source of cultural variety than is class itself."

>Bourdieu's analysis of class and culture errs in neglecting two important aspects of social structure: social networks and class relations at work. He expects high-status culture to be useful in class because it is correlated with class, but culture used at work includes both genres related to class (used in domination) and genres unrelated to class (used in coordination). High-status culture is correlated with class but excluded, not used, in the competitive private sector. The most widely useful cultural resource is cultural variety, and social network variety is a better source of cultural variety than is class itself.

Bourdieu doesn't say enough about personal networks and work relationships. Personal networks (social capital?)

Erickson argues Bourdieu says that the highest classes become the most distinguished culture. Culture then becomes a class signal that helps to maintain domination as much as the economy.

So economy and culture play into class.
>The vertical dimension concerns capital volume: the higher the class, the more eco- nomic and cultural capital people tend to have. The horizontal dimension concerns the composition of capital, or the strength of cultural capital versus economic capital. p.3

There is a domain specific version of these things.

>in more detailed analysis, Bourdieu em- phasizes "fields," or particular social settings in which class dynamics take place. Fields vary in the relative importance of economic versus cultural capital, but people always get ranked by some combination of these. Fields vary in their cultural level and range, but, within each field, the higher ranks have more prestigious culture, and this culture helps them both to dominate and to legitimate their domination. Fields vary in the particular forms of culture that pay off, but, in each field, the relevant forms are selected from the overall cultural hierarchy in ways that favor the dominant people in the field p.3

Bourdieu negelcts, then, social capital. Also, he does not focus enough on cultural variety as a resource, focusing only on a dominant idea.

Erickson also argues that Bourdieu does not focus enough on coordination, instead zeroing in on only domination. Also, highbrow culture does not concern the vast majority of businesses.

The idea is that one must be linked with cultural variety, which is tied to social network variety. Those exposed to more do better. Network variety, then, is the number of classes represented ina  network.

>Like Mannheim (1952), Bourdieu argues that cultural orientations learned early in life are unconscious, taken for granted, hard to change, and powerful in shaping responses to later experiences. p.7 -

 so people are naturally drawn to higher-class things. HOwever, Erickson argues that we cannot simply rely on our family. The world changes too much, things become outmoded. YOu have to keep learning new things! THus, network variety is important.

 >Instead of arguing that culture is a unidimensional matter deeply im- printed in early life, I argue that culture includes many genres learned at different times of life. For example, people often become sports buffs in childhood and adolescence, learn much of what they know about highbrow books or art in school but get their knowledge of current busi- ness trends or restaurants in the present day. It follows that one's family origins, schooling, past class locations, and current class have different relative importance for different genres p.8

 I think this is pretty weak.

 But Erickson agrees, while some genres bridge gaps, others can reproduce it. Sports, for instance, helps everyone, but women and foreign born are marginalized.

 Here is the ultimate question - if network variety increases the amount of people you can coordinate with (and thus dominate), why do women not like sports? There are two types of inequality there Erickson says.

 >From the individual's point of view, it follows that the most useful cultural resource is a little working knowledge of a lot of cultural genres combined with a good understanding of which culture to use in which contex p.9

>Cultural variety does not come primarily from class, or any other single kind of attribute or social location, since each of these is related to just some forms of culture. Instead, the most powerful single teacher of cultural variety is contact with people in many different loca- tions: network variety builds cultural variety. Advantaged people, in- cluding higher-class people, will certainly have better cultural resources, but this is not because of their class as such but because of the diverse networks that advantaged people have. p.9

This argument sucks. It is tested using a survey of Toronto security industry as a field.

I think part of ignoring what's going on here is that the capital in use is field specific, in understanding organizations there might be some field specific variations that shift the focus away from high brow culture. About half did personal interviews. They use Wright's version of class to categorize occupations into classes which can then measure network variety.

They then measured cultural variety as whether they had heard of lots of things. People with a higher class go to better restaurants and read specific magazines.

There are also genres that cut across class, and sports is really the one.

Many could not find anything in common with coworkers.

>Employees do the least rewarding work and are the least likely to see work as a common interest. The common interest is sometimes a negative one ("telling horror stories"). Their comments also tend to focus on their own jobs and the people they deal with directly ("providing good service," "watching each other's backs") with only two references to the company as a whole.p.18

This whole study is total garbage - it puts Bourdieu into a corner he does not belong in, and uses methods that are extremely questionable. It is an interesting extension of the omnivorousness argument though.

Weak ties mostly increase network diversity. In a regression of knowing about high class things, early life information is just as important as network variety. It may be clear though that higher class people have more diversity, right? And if you come into contact with higher class people on the reg then maybe you're figuring something out?
