Joe's suggestion - Right after the introduction - put the context part

That way when you go through the more literature part


Mary also thinks you should ?


(How much does Sameer start at it in the abstract)


Joe - when you talk about imprinting earlier you can maybe move the hypotheses and new things you might expand on and test -

Each of these things could be a paragraph drawing on the literature and you could do your hypotheses earlier. Add the hypotheses earlier and make it more real.
