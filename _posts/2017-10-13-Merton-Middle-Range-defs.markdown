<def>What are middle range theories according to Merton?: Middle range theory is the theory between the day to day and the over-arching ideas. It seems like most sociology these days is middle range. For example, theories on norms, role conflict and social mobility would be middle range theories.</def>

Merton talks about relative deprevation, making the following insight:
>Within a particular class of behavior, therefore, the theory of relative deprivation directs us to a set of hypotheses that can be empirically tested. The confirmed conclusion can then be put simply enough: when few are hurt to much the same extent, the pain and loss of each seems great; where many are hurt in greatly varying degree, even fairly large losses seem small as they are compared with far larger ones.

This middle range theory like other ones is not derived from some logical whole, it is isolated propositions.

Consider role set theory, where individuals play a number of roles in different situations.
>Thus, a person in the status of medical student plays not only the role of student vis-Ã -vis the correlative status of his teachers, but also an array of other roles relating him diversely to others in the system: other students, physicians, nurses, social workers, medical technicians, and the like.  p.42

One must play these roles in different parts. This type of theory can play a role in Marxist or Parsonian "large theory" ideas. They also give rise to a number of additional questions, like when must a person articulate a role set.

>As a theory of the middle range, then, the theory of role-sets begins with a concept and its associated imagery and generates an array of theoretical problems. Thus, the assumed structural basis for potential disturbance of a role-set gives rise to a double question (which, the record shows, has not been raised in the absence of the theory): which social mechanisms, if any, operate to counteract the theoretically assumed instability of role-sets and, correlatively, under which circumstances do these social mechanisms fail to operate, with resulting inefficiency, confusion, and conflict?  p.45

## Total Systems of Sociological Theory
 >Some sociologists still write as though they expect, here and now, formulation of the general sociological theory broad enough to encompass the vast ranges of precisely observed details of social behavior, organization, and change and fruitful enough to direct the attention of research workers to a flow of problems for empirical research. This I take to be a premature and apocalyptic belief. We are not ready. Not enough preparatory work has been done. p.45

 Merton seems to believe that the larger systems need to be made in the context of middle range theories, and not vice versa.

Everyone tried to create their own systems and it's a goof, really. People in sociology are thus differentiated more philosophically as they join one goofy system over another.  These models almost never adapt in the same way they do in the natural sciences. Not to mention natural scientists don't think they have an all econompassing theory.

>The misplaced masochism of the social scientist and the inadvertent sadism of the public both result from the failure to remember that social science, like all science, is continually developing and that there is no providential dispensation providing that at any given moment it will be adequate to the entire array of problems confronting men. In historical perspective this expectation would be equivalent to having forever prejudged the status and promise of medicine in the seventeenth century according to its ability to produce, then and there, a cure or even a preventative for cardiac diseases. p.49

Things don't just show up, you can only solve practical and theoretical problems by doing work in the middle range.

## Total Systems of Theory and Theories of the Middle Range
WE can only advance sociology if we do theories of the middle range. We develop hypotheses that can be empirically investigated, that when put together can really consolidate these groups.

>Our major task today is to develop special theories applicable to limited conceptual ranges -- theories, for example, of deviant behavior, the unanticipated consequences of purposive action, social perception, reference groups, social control, the interdependence of social institutions -- rather than to seek immediately the total conceptual structure that is adequate to derive these and other theories of the middle range. p.51

## Polarization

Some people have different responses to the idea of middle ranged theories. Some people are fine with it as they are already essentially conducting it. Others are more concerned.
Some of the people are concerned have intense ties to a particular methodology or deep idea of how sociology must be done that is kind of an all or nothing proposition. People used to do only this theoretical search for an all encompassing theory, and thus there used to be very little middle range theory.

Merton sees Durkheim's suicide as a classic view of middle rnage.

## Rejection

Some would say they have low intellectual ambitions. THis is because middle range theory (or the conception of it) is newer, even though our foremost ancestors are essentially doing middle range tehory. There are also misconceptions about exactly what middle range theory is.

Some might reject middle range theory because it scatters sociology, but does it not also bring it together?

Here is Merton's full summary of middle range theory:

1. Middle-range theories consist of limited sets of assumptions from which specific hypotheses are logically derived and confirmed by empirical investigation.

2. These theories do not remain separate but are consolidated into wider networks of theory, as illustrated by theories of level of aspiration, reference-group, and opportunity-structure.

3. These theories are sufficiently abstract to deal with differing spheres of social behavior and social structure, so that they transcend sheer description or empirical generalization. The theory of social conflict, for example, has been applied to ethnic and racial conflict, class conflict, and international conflict.

4. This type of theory cuts across the distinction between microsociological problems, as evidenced in small group research, and macro-sociological problems, as evidenced in comparative studies of social mobility and formal organization, and the interdependence of social institutions.

5. Total sociological systems of theory -- such as Marx's historical materialism, Parson's theory of social systems and Sorokin's integral sociology -- represent general theoretical orientations rather than the rigorous and tightknit systems envisaged in the search for a "unified theory" in physics.

6. As a result, many theories of the middle range are consonant with a variety of systems of sociological thought.

7. Theories of the middle range are typically in direct line of continuity with the work of classical theoretical formulations. We are all residuary legatees of Durkheim and Weber, whose works furnish ideas to be followed up, exemplify tactics of theorizing, provide models for the exercise of taste in the selection of problems, and instruct us in raising theoretical questions that develop out of theirs.

8. The middle-range orientation involves the specification of ignorance. Rather than pretend to knowledge where it is in fact absent, it expressly recognizes what must still be learned in order to lay the foundation for still more knowledge. It does not assume itself to be equal to the task of providing theoretical solutions to all the urgent practical problems of the day but addresses itself to those problems that might now be clarified in the light of available knowledge.

Big theories are sometimes thought of as "paradigms" a concept that is more an introduction to the next section, but is interesting as a way of putting together middle ranged theories.
