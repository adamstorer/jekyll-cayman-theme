<def>Political Community: A community whose social action is aimed at subordinating to orderly domination by the participants a territory and the conduct of persons within it, through readiness to resort to physical force</def>

This setup is seemingly ubiquitous now but has not answered forever. What's the difference between this and a regular community

<def>Community: A community constitutes more than an economic group, it must share some value systems other than economic goods.</def>

This is different from a political community, which really only has to do bare maintenance of its dominion over a territory.

A political community, then is a:
1. Territory
2. Has the availability of physical force for domination
3. Social action which is not restricted exclusively to the satisfaction of economic needs, and regulates more generally the interrelations of the territory.

In the older times this could be hard to break out because you had undifferentiated economic needs and kinship groups that were doing a lot o work. And in these situations it is kind of hard to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate violence. This is kind of called the "warrior group"

The warrior group may dismantle itself, or it may turn into something larger: a comprehensive political consociation...interested in obtaining such control because all of its members may have to suffer from the reprisals against the warriors' raids. Economically interested groups will argue mostly for pacification. This constitutes development along two lines:
1. Monopolizawtion of legitimate violence by the state
2. The rationalization of the rules of its application


### Power Prestige and the "Great Powers"
The ability to change political attitudes about how to influence power is a special kind of prestige that is sometimes the beginning of war. The polities who feel power prestige over the whole word (or individuals?) are the "great powers".  
<def>Power Prestige: The ability to influence how power is wielded gives some kind of prestige</def>
<def>"Great Powers": The polities who feel power prestige over large parts of the world.</def>

### Economic Foundations of Imperialism
Great Powers and economic ability are not necessarily as linked as you might think. Trade also does not determine whether great powers will search for expansion (which is one of the defining aspects of great powers)

>"The economic structure does co-determine the extent and manner of political expansion." p.915

Sometimes capitalist interest groups want trade and we get something like - imperialist capitalism.
For imperialist capitalism, the best way to secure profit is to have some form of occupation.
Economic impacts can sometimes make imperialism through war seem undesirable, since this is a very large risk to the bottom line if you lose the war.

## The nation
Sometimes those with power prestige can bring war even when it is economically unviable. The people who seek power prestige are the most likely to bring the idea of a 'state' to bear on other states. Many ideas are privileged within a strata (ideologies, a specific 'culture'). and become codified within the nation.

What is the nation?
<def>nation (as those who use it mean it):it is proper to expect from certain groups a specific sentiment of solidarity in the face of other groups. Thus, a sphere of values</def>

National affiliation cannot be broken down into a common bloodline, a common language.

Some people (like communists) consider indifference to national character (and in turn a focus on class) a win.

Weber wants to focus moreo n 'prestige' interests w.r.t the nation. The nation, when juxtaposed with another, is often used to invoke a superiority of culture, or to bring some kind of cultural mission. Those in power invoke the idea of a state, and are focused on a national idea.

## The distribution of power within the political community: Class, Status, Party

### Economically Determined Power and the Status Order
Legal orders effect the distribution of power, including economic power.
<def>Power:The chance of a man or a number of men to realize their own will in a social action even against the resistance of others who are participating in the action</def>

Power may be valued for its own sake, as well as to enrich yourself. Social honor has a strange relationship with economic power, in that purely seeking naked economic power does not grant you social honor, but they are often connected.

<def>Status Order: The way in which social honor is distributed in a community between typical groups</def>

Economic order is differnet, but not so different.

### Class Situation by Market situation

<def>What is a class/class situation?: When people have a specific causal component of their life chances in common, this component is represented exclusively by economic interests, and is represented under the conditions of the commodity or labor markets. p.927</def>

These classes can be really differentiated or similar depending on how intensely you want to dive in (cattle owners may be a class, farm workers and farm workers on a specific crop could be one or two classes)

### Social Action Flowing from Class Interest

Class interests fall apart once people start to move from class situation to something more concrete. For interest, people may respond to their class situation in different ways. One may form a formal group or not, and one or the other is not a universal phenomenon. Social action may emerge that is simply grumbling, or a huge overthrow.

>The degree in which "social action"
and possibly associations emerge from the mass behavior of the members
of a class is linked to general cultural conditions, especially to those of
an intellectual sort. It is also linked to the extent of the contrasts that
have already evolved, and is especially linked. to the transparency of the
connections between the causes and the consequences of the class situation.p.929

People may react to class structure through social acts (mass action) only from certain distributions of property and the structure of the concrete econoimc order.

### Types of Class Struggle

A class may not even lead to a true group. In response to Mars:
>That men in the same class situation regularly
react in mass actions to such tangible situations as economic ones
in the direction of those interests that are most adequate to their average ,
number is an important and after all simple fact for the understanding
of historical events. However, this fact must not lead to that kind of
pseudo-scientific operation with the concepts of class and class interests
which is so frequent these days and which has found its most classic
expression in the statement of a talented author, that the individual may
be in error concerning his interests but that the class is infallible about
its interests.

If market interests are as clear as possible and all other relations are clear, we may get as close to carrying out market principles (or class actions) as we may see fit.

Status groups may hinder such change. They can change the ways the fight spreads, when it stops and where it goes.

### Status Honor

Status groups are normally amorphous groups. Just as we have a class situation, we have a stautus situation.
<def>Status Situation: Every typical component of the life of men that is determined by a specific, positive or negative, social estimation of honor.</def>
Class and status situations can of course be linked to one another.

### Ethnic Segregation and Caste
Status groups can sometimes evolve into a closed caste, and people automatically have higher or lower status situations by birht. This is usually backed up by some idea that the difference is ethnic?
<def>What is the logical conclusion of a status group: A caste backed up by some idea of ethnic dissimilarity p.934</def>

>Very frequently a status group is instrumental in the
production of a thoroughbred anthropological type. Certainly status
groups are to a high degree effective in producing extreme types, for they
select personally qualified individuals (e.g. the knighthood selects those
who are fit for warfare, physically and psychically). But individual selection
is far from being the only, or the predominant, way in which status
groups are formed: political membership or class situation has at all
times been at least as frequently decisive

### Status Privileges

Usually stratificaition by status means stratification of ideal goods. Often times a status groups preference for a certain profession can lead to a legal monooply.

### Economic Conditions and Effects of Status stratification
>The status order would be threatened at its very root if mere economic
acquisition and naked economic power still bearing the stigma of its
extra-status origin could bestow upon anyone who has won them the
same or even greater honor as the vested interests claim for themselves.
After all, given equality of status honor, property per se represents an
addition even if it is not openly acknowledged to be such. Therefore all
groups having interest in the status order react with special sharpness
precisely against the pretensions of purely economic acquisition. In most
cases they react the more vigorously the more they feel themselves
threatened.

This is because the market is aplace where status can (techincally) be won or lost.

>With some over~simplification, one might thus say that classes are
stratifie.d according to tb~r relations to the production and acquisition of
goods; whereas status groups are stratified according to the principles ofs
the~r consumption of goods as represented by ,special styles of life. p.937


### Parties
There is the economic and social order, but also the legal order, and the groups described above often attempt to work on the legal order. Parties reside here, in the sphere of POWER.

>Pa.rties are, therefore, only possible within groups
that have an associational character, that is, some rational order arid a
staff of persons available who are ready to enforce it. For parties aim
precisely at influencing this staff, and if possible, to recruit from it party
'members. p.939

The structure of parties is more vague and they can be any combination of the previous two, and vary a lot depending on what they are trying to accomplish and how long they hope to stick around. These partires are not even really confined to a nation.
