From Nancy Frasers Discussion:

<def>The Public Sphere: A discursive arena in modern societies where private persons discuss matters of common concern.</def>

>this arena is ideally the site of free, unrestricted, rational communication.
A vehicle for unmasking domination, “publicity” is supposed to
constitute a medium for scrutinizing the actions of state officials and the
operation of private powers, holding the first accountable and encouraging
them to rein in the second. While the ideal of the public sphere bears little
resemblance to actually existing arenas of manipulated pseudopublicity, it
affords a normative yardstick for criticizing the latter. In general, then, this
concept supplies a rubric for evaluating the legitimacy and efficacy of what
passes for “public opinion” in modern societies. p. 245

The idea unfolds both historically and normatively.
>In the historical register, Habermas sketches the rise and fall of the public
sphere from the perspective of a still incomplete process of democratization.
He locates the emergence of its modern guise in Europe and North America in
the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Reversing the previous feudal
type of “representative publicity,” in which rulers conspicuously displayed
their power and wealth, the new “bourgeois” publics were composed of private
persons who gathered in salons and coffee houses to discuss matters of “common
concern,”

First this meant making information about how the state functions public. Then it meant transmitting general interest to the state via free speech and eventually through government itself. But as the whole mass of the public becomes involved, reasoned public debate devolved into brokered compromises of private interests.

>In the normative register,
by contrast, he stressed the idea’s critical force and emancipatory potential.
Here the public sphere was associated with a highly demanding type of
communication—rational, inclusive, unrestricted. In principle open to all,
modern publics of private persons were supposed to generate public opinion
in the strong sense of a rationally warranted consensus about the common
good.p.247

>In general, then, Structural Transformation posed a sharp contrast between
the deformed pseudopublicity of contemporary society and a normative ideal
whose emancipatory promise Habermas wished to redeem. But the book
offered little concrete guidance for envisioning a “postbourgeois” mode of
publicity for contemporary societies. From the start, accordingly, it provoked
unease, along with admiration, in many readers.


# A Review by Craig Calhoun

THis was a late translation into english. It is historically concrete and discusses France, Britain and Germany.
>It replaced, gradually, the previous major form of public- ity or public communication, the representa- tions of authority performed by monarchs and nobility. In this it transcended mere debate over culture to create a political public sphere. Ultimately, however, further transfor- mations in both social structural foundations and forms of communication led to the degeneration and distorition of the public sphere.

Habermas does four things:
1. Consider the intellecutal history of the public sphere - This means looking at HObbes and Locke
>He finds the full notion of public opinion to be enunciated classically by Kant, for whom public opinion aims at rationalizing politics in the name of morality. Kant's notion of public opinion depends, Habermas argues, on the social conditions of the liberal public sphere-that is, on early capitalism with its division of state from civil society and its relative equality of status among the restricted ranks of property owners, ranging from artisans through substantial merchants.

2. The interrelation of nonpolitical public sphere to the political.
>He is concerned particularly with the creation of a literary public sphere among readers of novels and theater audi- ences. A central theme is the change wrought in this literary public sphere as it becomes less fully a discursive realm characterized by intellectual exchanges among the members of a reading public, and more one of consump- tion.

These things are done in public, but are not really public unless it incorporates a debate.

3. The role of changes in the technologies and social organization of communication.
>Habermas joins in a widespread criticism of the new media as undermining a discursive relationship among members of their audience. These media participate in (though by themselves are not the full cause of) a problematic mutual infiltration of public and private spheres

4. The transformation of social and political institutions.
>His account of the genesis of the bourgeois public sphere is, of course, tied to the rise and transforma- tion of both capitalism and the state. Above all, it is linked in practice as well as in normative thought to the separation of the wielding of political power from the pursuit of economic ends. The political public sphere presumes that its members are formally equal in their capacity to attain relevant information and develop informed opinions about it through rational-critical discourse.

>The distance between this idealized image and actual practices grows, however, as parliament becomes a vehicle not for rational-critical debate but for the enunciation of preset opinions, the announcement of compromises reached "behind the scenes," and the appeal of politicians for the acclamation of voters
