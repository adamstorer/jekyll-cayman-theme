Based off of some of Marx's other writings, we start with the notion that laborers become relatively more poor in relation to capitalists the more productive they are. The harder they work, or the more they produce, the more devalued the worker is, and the more likely s/he is to be seen as a commodity.

This is because labor's product is not owned by labor, instead it is something alien. The "realization" of labor as objects leads to labors objectification, and thus loss of realization for the workers. (I am not sure what realization means here, realization of profit perhaps?)
This is meant to mean that workers have the same relation to their labor as any other alien object, they have no personal relationship with him. And, unfortunately, this alien world that he creates subjugates him.
From Marx
>Whatever the product of his labor is, he is not. Therefore, the greater this product, the less is he himself. The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labor becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power on its own confronting him. It means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien.

The relationship, Marx argues, is hidden in economics, but it does not consider the relationship between the work and production. Marx doesn't seem too concerned about the ability to save or the ability to make a living. The estrangement, it seems to me, is relative. That is, even if laborers can produce enough to live, have an agreeable enough live, and even save a sum of money, this is nothing compared to the top 1%, or the amount of value that they produce.

But alienated labor also means the estrangement of the productive activity to the act of production. If you are putting yourself into what you make, then you are estranging yourself from yourself. Marx argues that since the labor is external to the worker, it does not belong to his "intrinsic nature" whatever that is. Marx argues:

>he does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself.

This means to say that the labor is forced onto the laborer.  The laboring itself is not satisfying, but a means to satisfy oneself. This means that you are estranged from your own activity. Marx calls this "self-estrangement"

In a third section, Marx argues that man is a "species-being," derived from the philosophy of Feuerbach. There might be something in The German Ideology or something by Feuerbach that goes deeper into this philosophy, but my guess is that it sits kind of at the core of some of the later ideas of alienation. Marx agues man is a species-being because:
> not only because in practice and in theory he adopts the species (his own as well as those of other things) as his object, but – and this is only another way of expressing it – also because he treats himself as the actual, living species; because he treats himself as a universal and therefore a free being.

The use of "universal" here is reminiscent of Hegel's Philosophy of Right and the notion that we think of "man" not as atomistic but as part of a whole, such as a State, or a world-society. Here is another section which defines universality a little bit differently:
>The universality of man appears in practice precisely in the universality which makes all nature his inorganic body – both inasmuch as nature is (1) his direct means of life, and (2) the material, the object, and the instrument of his life activity.

So Marx argues that we have different levels of alienation and so far we have:
1. Alienation of Man from nature (the product of his labor)
2. Alienation of Man from himself (the act of laboring)
3. Alienation of Man from the species.

The third aspect takes place because it separates the individual from the species, and it makes individual life, the purpose of the life of the species. Marx believes that man's species-character is "free, conscious activity" and simply producing in a capitalist way separtes man from his species-character. Marx argues that, since man is conscious, it's character is free, conscious activity.

>It is just in his work upon the objective world, therefore, that man really proves himself to be a species-being. This production is his active species-life. Through this production, nature appears as his work and his reality. The object of labor is, therefore, the objectification of man’s species-life: for he duplicates himself not only, as in consciousness, intellectually, but also actively, in reality, and therefore he sees himself in a world that he has created.

Marx breaks down number 3 into two parts.
3. Alienation of Man from the species-being, his "spiritual aspect, his human aspect"
4. Alienation of Men from each other. Men cannot see each other as part of a conscious, collective species, but only as objects of labor.

In the next section, Marx asks how we make sense of our alienation. That is, who is the alien being? Marx suggests the gods or nature, but dispels these ideas. It can only be man that does this alienation. Some other man than the worker, who is reaping the rewards, who is making someone else's alien their object. And workers produce this man.

So, what if we raised the minimum wage???
>An enforced increase of wages (disregarding all other difficulties, including the fact that it would only be by force, too, that such an increase, being an anomaly, could be maintained) would therefore be nothing but better payment for the slave, and would not win either for the worker or for labor their human status and dignity.
Indeed, even the equality of wages, as demanded by Proudhon, only transforms the relationship of the present-day worker to his labor into the relationship of all men to labor. Society would then be conceived as an abstract capitalist.

Being paid a fair wage to work on something you do not want to work on, still does not save you from the fact that you would not work if you didn't have to. That it still estranges your activity from yourself. The only way to move from estranged labor is to get rid of wages altogether.

Marx argues that the relationship between estranged labor and private property shows that the only way to not have estranged labor is to not have private property. This would be the emancipation of the workers, which would lead to "universal human emancipation."  In Capital Marx tries to show that money is only a particular and developed expression of these elements. Marx is trying to map human history, human development, along these lines.
