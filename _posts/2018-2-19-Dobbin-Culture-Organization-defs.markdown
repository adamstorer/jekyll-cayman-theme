People think of orgs and bureaucracies as social structures that are affected by culture.

# Weber and Parsons

Organizations are not culture, according to these guys, is because instrumental institutions are not symbolic.

>By neglecting rationality as a cultural
construct we have acted the part of indigenous anthroplogists
who treat every aspect of social life as cultural except the
elaborate, purposive customs designed to win the deity's help with
the crop yield and fertility. p. 3

Weber was caught in the middle somehow. In sociological analysis we saw that all social practices needed interpretation. Rational action lets us see how actors interpret their own actions.

The indeterminancy of Weber's social vs rational was missed by Parsons.

## Organizations as Culture

With some guys we get organizations as culture, particularly with marxists. We also see it more with the phenomonologists.
>By suggesting that
instrumental rationality is just one in a aeries of constructed meaning
systems, alongside mysticismI religionJ and secular philosophy,
the phenomenological approach its modernity problernaiizes
foundations of rationality that most soda1 scientists thought they
did not have to explain. p 122

## Four themes in Cultural Approaches to Rational Organizations

Early studies were done on educational organizations or health providers. They showed that organizations that formally adopted certain pracices sometimes failed to adopt that practice.  They studied orgs that were self-consciously cultural, subject to government mandates, adopted practices that had become instiutionalized externally, and that adopted rules without regard to implementation.

But doing this meant that they could bracket the extent to which thes eorganizations are thought to be cultural we miss a few things.

### CUlture qua norms to culture qua instrumental rationality.

They make a distinction between instiutional organizations (governmental and nonprofit) and technical organizations (for profit organization). By doing so, they got to keep some rationality as real. For instance, by tracing symbolic equity actions in instrumental and technical sectors alike, and these things became necessary not due to a single rational thought but because of organizational dynamics.

That is, the rationalized processes are themselves culturally constructed.



Also we see that practices are the result of organizational imprinting. This is maybe how organizations come to realize what is rational. WE frequently find that practices emerge idiosyncratically.

Here we have to get into the organization, the black box, and understand how things are negotiated and understood.

So we must evenually come to the question of hwether eslf interest is innate?? Who knows, maybe not. We must realize that what we have now is only one of possible outcomes, and the field of possible difference is quite broad.

## From Sybmolic-because-decouple to cultural-because-indeterminate

We must consider how symbology and practice can sometimes be decoupled. This is a real parsonian view.

>cultural approaches to organizations question how our
contemporary social categories andd notions of rationality emerged.
They presume that these ccategaries and notisans represent properly
social phenomena, rather than transcendental rules of economic or
political order. p. 139
