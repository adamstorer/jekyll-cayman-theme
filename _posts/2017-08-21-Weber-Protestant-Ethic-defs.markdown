## Religious Affiliation and Social Stratification

Why is it that all of the business leaders are protestant in countries with mixed religions?

Some jump from economic traditionalism to a more 'capitalist' form of thought mayb e related to religion.

>It will be our task to investigate these religions with a view to
finding out what peculiarities they have or have had which
might have resulted in the behaviour we have described. On
superficial analysis, and on the basis of certain current impressions,
one might be tempted to express the difference by saying
that the greater other-worldliness of Catholicism, the ascetic
character of its highest ideals, must have brought up its
adherents to a greater indifference toward the good things of
this world. p.7

Portestantism and especially Calvinism seems to be tied up very often with high class/business leaders.

>If any inner relationship between certain expressions of
the old Protestant spirit and modern capitalistic culture is to be
found, we must attempt to find it, for better or worse not in its
alleged more or less materialistic or at least anti-ascetic joy of
living, but in its purely religious characteristics p.11


## The Spirit of Capitalism

<def>what is a historical individual? how is it useful in explaining the spirit of capitalism: the historic individual is complex of elements associated in historical reality which we unite into a conceptual whole from the standpoint of their cultural significance. The concept of the spirit of capitalism can only really be defined in this way.</def>

>Thus, if we try to determine the object, the analysis and historical
explanation of which we are attempting, it cannot be in
the form of a conceptual definition, but at least in the beginning
only a provisional description of what is here meant by the spirit
of capitalism. p.14

Then we get a bunch of quotes by Benjamin Franklin talking about how time is money and saying that we shouldn't sit idly by. Here we have some ideal of the honest man to have a duty to increase his capital as an end in itself. It is important here that you don't spend the money, you just collect it.

>In fact, the summum bonum of this ethic, the earning of more
and more money, combined with the strict avoidance of all
spontaneous enjoyment of life, is above all completely devoid of
any eudæmonistic, not to say hedonistic, admixture. It is
thought of so purely as an end in itself, that from the point of
view of the happiness of, or utility to, the single individual, it
appears entirely transcendental and absolutely irrational. p.18

>The earning of money within the modern economic order is, so long
as it is done legally, the result and the expression of virtue and
proficiency in a calling; and this virtue and proficiency are, as it
is now not difficult to see, the real Alpha and Omega of Franklin’s
ethic, as expressed in the passages we have quoted, as well
as in all his works without exception. p.19

But where did this economic life of work through "survival of the fittest" come from? It can't be explained through one person! What's more strange, this attitude (money for money's sake, survival of the fittest) is pretty different and even pretty negatively viewed by a large group of people.

Laborers, for example, work using piece rates, and it used to be the case that once you made enough to survive you would stop. "The opportunity of earning more was less attractive than that of working less." This is a shift in perspective more than a shift in the "superstructure" or economic system.

>Labour must, on the contrary,
be performed as if it were an absolute end in itself, a
calling. But such an attitude is by no means a product of nature. It
cannot be evoked by low wages or high ones alone, but can only
be the product of a long and arduous process of education. Today,
capitalism, once in the saddle, can recruit its labouring force
in all industrial countries with comparative ease p.27

This is all meant to say that the form of capitalist enterprise is dependent on more than the way money is exchanged or work is doled out. It requires also a particular attitude. And the attitude and the forms of compensation do not perfectly co-occur.

<def>Why do laborers and piece rate systems make arguments about "superstructure" hard to swallow?: Laborers used to do piecework until they had enough money for the day, not until they had as much money as possible</def>

For laborers and entrepreneurs, the approach to business can be "traditional" even if there is rational book keeping and capitalistic activity. And then some spirit of modern capitalism seems to strike an entrepreneur, and we are off to the races. Usually these people are hard working, are calculating and daring.

>The ideal type of the capitalistic
entrepreneur, as it has been represented even in Germany by
occasional outstanding examples, has no relation to such more
or less refined climbers. He avoids ostentation and unnecessary
expenditure, as well as conscious enjoyment of his power, and is
embarrassed by the outward signs of the social recognition
which he receives. His manner of life is, in other words, often,
and we shall have to investigate the historical significance of just
this important fact, distinguished by a certain ascetic tendency,
as appears clearly enough in the sermon of Franklin which we
have quoted. p.33

But today the world has changed, and it is either act like a capitalist or fail (or at least do not rise) . It is emancipated from its old supports.

>Rationalism is an historical concept which covers
a whole world of different things. It will be our task to find out
whose intellectual child the particular concrete form of rational
thought was, from which the idea of a calling and the devotion
to labour in the calling has grown, which is, as we have seen,
so irrational from the standpoint of purely eudæmonistic
self-interest, but which has been and still is one of the most
characteristic elements of our capitalistic culture. We are here
particularly interested in the origin of precisely the irrational
element which lies in this, as in every conception of a calling. p.38


## Luther's Conception of The calling

A calling seems to be a religious conception, a task set by God.

<def>What is a calling?: A life task, a definite field in which to work, given by god</def>

Luther had the first idea for the calling that is part of all protestantism:
>The only way of
living acceptably to God was not to surpass worldly morality in
monastic asceticism, but solely through the fulfilment of the
obligations imposed upon the individual by his position in the
world. That was his calling. p.40

Labour as a calling is an "outward expression of brotherly love," whereas pretty much all other religions took worldly activity as something almost ungodly. While this does not directly translate into the spirit of capitalism, we can see pieces of its history here.

But within protestantism there was a wide variety of ideas about the calling.

<def>What does Lutheranism have to do with the spirit of capitalism?: It gave a moral reason to participate in worldly activity.</def>

From these we have the spiritucalsuccesors of calvinism and other 'puritan' movements.



# Part 2 - The Practical Ethics of the Ascetic Branches of protestantism

## The Religious Foundations of Worldly Ascietism

There are four forms of protestantims
1. calvinism
2. Pietism - Broke off from calvinism but was eventually reabsorbdd into lutheranism.
3. Methodism
4. Baptist

### Calvinism

<def>What was Calvinisms most characteristic dogma?: Predestination</def>

This means you are already chosen as sinner or saved, and man cannot intervene in the fate that God has chosen for you.
>For the damned to complain of their lot would be much the
same as for animals to bemoan the fact they were not born as
men. For everything of the flesh is separated from God by an
unbridgeable gulf and deserves of Him only eternal death, in so
far as He has not decreed otherwise for the glorification of His
Majesty. We know only that a part of humanity is saved, the rest
damned. To assume that human merit or guilt play a part in
determining this destiny would be to think of God’s absolutely
free decrees, which have been settled from eternity, as subject to
change by human influence, an impossible contradiction p.60

Spiritually, this means that people are isolated from others as they ponder whether they're destined for heaven or hell. But people must still work.
>The world exists to serve the
glorification of God and for that purpose alone. The elected
Christian is in the world only to increase this glory of God by
fulfilling His commandments to the best of his ability. But God
requires social achievement of the Christian because He wills
that social life shall be organized according to His commandments,
in accordance with that purpose. p. 64

So people labour to create social usefulness to fulfill the glory of god. And people knew they were the elect individuals, with the glory of god, if theey were fulfilling god's wishes.

> The religious
believer can make himself sure of his state of grace either in that
he feels himself to be the vessel of the Holy Spirit or the tool of
the divine will. In the former case his religious life tends to
mysticism and emotionalism, in the latter to ascetic action;
Luther stood close to the former type, Calvinism belonged definitely
to the latter...Thus the Calvinist, as it is sometimes put, himself
creates his own salvation, or, as would be more correct, the
conviction of it. But this creation cannot, as in Catholicism, consist
in a gradual accumulation of individual good works to one’s
credit, but rather in a systematic self-control which at every
moment stands before the inexorable alternative, chosen or damned.


For the puritans, asceticism was about getting rid of spontaneous enjoyment. For the calvinists, this meant activity within the world. (p.74) You didn't know if you were saved, but you know that saved people would act in the world in certain ways.

Weber then goes on to use something like the method of difference to to distinguish calvinisms particular brand of asceticism from other lutheran offshoots as the true progenitor of the spirit of capitalism.

## Asceticism and the Spirit of Capitalism

We move from focusing on the religious aspects of ascetic protestantism to understanding the business world. In ascetic protestantism, Calvinism was the most perfect formation of the protestant ethic. In the business world we have Richard Baxter. For Baxter, it was important not to relax in the security of possession or the enjoyment of wealth, but to simply continue to work.
>Waste of time is thus the first and in principle the deadliest of
sins. The span of human life is infinitely short and precious to
make sure of one’s own election. Loss of time through sociability,
idle talk,10 luxury,11 even more sleep than is necessary for
health,12 six to at most eight hours, is worthy of absolute moral
condemnation p. 104

Baxter preached nearly continuous hard work. You work hard, but it is not for the luxury. For puritans, the separation of men into classes and the division of labor is a way to fulfill god's will and serve the common good.

>It is true that the usefulness of a calling, and thus its favour in
the sight of God, is measured primarily in moral terms, and thus
in terms of the importance of the goods produced in it for the
community. But a further, and, above all, in practice the most
important, criterion is found in private profitableness. p. 108

Weber sums up:
>This worldly Protestant asceticism, as we may recapitulate up
to this point, acted powerfully against the spontaneous enjoyment
of possessions; it restricted consumption, especially of
luxuries. On the other hand, it had the psychological effect of
freeing the acquisition of goods from the inhibitions of traditionalistic
ethics. It broke the bonds of the impulse of acquisition
in that it not only legalized it, but (in the sense discussed)
looked upon it as directly willed by God. The campaign against
the temptations of the flesh, and the dependence on external
things, was, as besides the Puritans the great Quaker apologist
Barclay expressly says, not a struggle against the rational acquisition,
but against the irrational use of wealth. p.115

In this way the puritan outlook favored the development of bourgeois rational economic life. But people can fall prey to wealth:
>In fact the whole history of monasticism is in a certain sense
the history of a continual struggle with the problem of the secularizing
influence of wealth. The same is true on a grand scale of
the worldly asceticism of Puritanism. p.118

Eventually wealth secularizes and the religious roots fall away:
>Then the intensity of the search for the Kingdom of
God commenced gradually to pass over into sober economic
virtue; the religious roots died out slowly, giving way to utilitarian
worldliness. Then, as Dowden puts it, as in Robinson Crusoe, the
isolated economic man who carries on missionary activities on
the side99 takes the place of the lonely spiritual search for the
Kingdom of Heaven of Bunyan’s pilgrim, hurrying through the
market-place of Vanity.

It solved the capital problem, butalso the labor problem:
>With
the consciousness of standing in the fullness of God’s grace
and being visibly blessed by Him, the bourgeois business man,
as long as he remained within the bounds of formal correctness,
as long as his moral conduct was spotless and the use to which he
put his wealth was not objectionable, could follow his pecuniary
interests as he would and feel that he was fulfilling a duty in doing
so. The power of religious asceticism provided him in addition
with sober, conscientious, and unusually industrious workmen,
who clung to their work as to a life purpose willed by God...Finally, it gave him the comforting assurance that the unequal distribution of the goods of this world was a special dispensation
of Divine Providence, which in these differences, as in particular
grace, pursued secret ends unknown to men p. 120

But when we lose the religious sense and are secularized good utilitarian workers, things are a little darker. The famous "iron cage" quote:
>The Puritan wanted to work in a calling; we are forced to do
so. For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cells into
everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, it did its
part in building the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic
order. This order is now bound to the technical and
economic conditions of machine production which to-day
determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this
mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic
acquisition, with irresistible force. Perhaps it will so determine
them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt. In Baxter’s view
the care for external goods should only lie on the shoulders of
the “saint like a light cloak, which can be thrown aside at any
moment”.114 But fate decreed that the cloak should become an
iron cage. p.123

Now we really want material goods more than before - and capitalism has developed beyond repair.









## Notes from a previous reading on the subject:
Weber, Max. The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism

Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. Introduction (pp.13-31). What does Weber mean by rationalization? What is the Spirit of Capitalism (pp.47-78); What is the Protestant Ethic? The difference between Luther and Calvin? (pp.79-128) What is the connection between Protestant Ethic and Spirit of Capitalism? What is the difference between the origins and the reproduction of capitalism? (pp.155-183)    Notes and Notes
Introduction
“The impulse of acquisition, pursuit of gain, of money, of the greatest possible amount of money, has in itself nothing to dow ith capitalism.” p.17

Capitalistic tendencies exist in all societies, but in western societies there is a particular form of capitalism that is more scientific, more rational, and more abstract.

What brings capitalism to this abstraction? p.25 “Among those of undoubted importance are the rational structures of law and of administration. For modern rational capitalism has need, not only of technical means of production, but of a calculable legal system and of administration in terms of formal rules.”

There is a western disposition p. 26 “For though the development of economic rationalism is partly dependent on rational technique and law, it is at the same time determined by the ability and disposition of men to adopt certain types of practional rational conduct.”

The disposition is one that can be hampered by p.27 “magical and religious forces, and the ethical ideas of duty based upon them, have in the past always been among the most important formative influences on conduct.”

Ch. 2
How do you understand the spirit of capitalism outside of religion? It can’t come from a conceptual division, but from a provisional description
p.48-51 “time is money” and other maxims of benjamin franklin given weber the idea of what the spirit is, it is a p.51 “philosophy of avarice” “it is not mere business astuteness, that sort of thing is common enough, it is an ethos.”

Franklin has a utilitarianism, p.52 “honesty is useful because it assures credit.” Virtues of honesty are only virtues “in so far as virtues as they are actually usedul to the individual, and the surrogate of mere appearance is always sufficient when it accomplished the end in view.”

While this seems like a mere logical capitalism Franklin “he ascribed his recognition of the utility of virtue to a divine revelation which was intended to lead him in the path of righteousness,” p.53

By putting money making over everything else in life, including the pleasures of everyday life, “economic acquisition is no longer subordinated to man as the means for the satisfaction of his material needs. This reversal of what we should call the natural relationship, so irrational from a naive point of view, is evidently as definitely a leading principle of capitalism as it is foreign to all peoples not under capitalistic influence.”

p.55 “In order that a manner of life so well adapted to the peculiarities of capitalism could be selected at all, i.e. should come to dominate others, it had to originatesomewhere, and not in isolated individuals alone, but as a way of life common to whole groups of men. This origin is what really needs explaining” …. “Without doubt, in the country of Benjamin Franklin’s birth, the spirit of capitalism was present before the capitalistic order.”

The capitalistic calculating tendencies of Franklin’s hometown do not directly correspond to origins, where the south was started as a money making enterprise and the north was founded by religious peoples”

We see the problem between economic incentives and different attitudes towards work particularly in piece rates, p.59 “Raising the piece-rates has often had the result that not more but less has been accomplished in the same time, because the worker reacted to the increase not by increasing by decreasing the amount of his work.” p.60 “The opportunity of earning more was less attractive than that of working less.”

Another way to increase productivity is to decrease wages, but you can’t decrease wages below a subsistence level (61). “For not only is a developed sense of responsibility absolutely indispensable, but in general also an attitude which, at least during working hours, is freed from continual calculations of how the customary wage may be earned with a maximum of comfort and a minimum of exertion.”

p.62 This can only happen through a long process of education which you see more with certain types of religions.. SO What is the relationship between the adaptability of capitalism and religion?

We see that these two things don’t have to take place at the same time: The form of the organization can be capitalistic, but the ethos of the business can be essentially traditional. The business can also be traditional but have a capitalist ethos (Franklin and his business)

What is a traditional business ethos? Where “the attainment of the goods necessary to meet personal needs” is the only point of the business. You are not looking for profit because of profit, but to subsist. p.64

People with the modern ethos of the capitalist spirit can overthrow those who operate within a traditional ethos. (69) these people don’t need great means to act, they simply need the spirit! **This is the story of the American Dream and I’m not sure how I feel about that**

Great Qute: Capitalists of today are not interested in “the pious boredom of paradise has little attraction for their active natures” Here p.70, man exists for the sake of his business, not for god!

Just as the spirit of capitalism can eliminate traditional forms of business, so can it eliminate religious forces (73)

Many religious ideas are inherently anti-capitalist, as you may have to do bad things to other people, and giving into that capitalism may make it difficult to be saved. Some people even returned money to former debtors. This is really interesting to me. What do people do with their money after they die? Is this information kept anywhere?

p.74-5 “The Fact to be explained historically is that in the most highly capitalistic centre of that time, in Florence of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the money and capital market of all the great political Powers, this attitude [the Franklin-esque attitude towards seeing as inseparable being good and doing good business] was considered ethically unustififiable, or at best tolerated.” At the same time in eighteenth century new england business ideas exist even when there is essentially no money.”

This capitalist spirit is made particularly apparent by its focus on rational calculation, though rational calculation alone does not give rise to the capitalist spirit. How do these two things go together? p.78 “It will be our task to find out whose intellectual child the particular concrete form of rational thought was, from which the idea of a calling and the devotion to labour in the calling has grown, which is, as we have seen, so irrational from the standpoint of purely eudaemonistic self-interest, but which has been and still is one of the most characteristic elements of our capitalistic culture. WE are here particularly interested in the origin of precisely the irrational element which lies in this, as in every conception of a calling.”

Chapter 3 - Luther’s Conception of the Calling
Most societies don’t have the concept of a calling, but protestants do. it is p.80 “a thing of the flesh, even though willed by god…The valuation of the fulfillment of duty in worldly affairs as the highest form which the moral activity of the individual could assume”
p.81 “Labour in a calling appears to him as the outward expression of brotherly love.”

However “The religious circles which today most enthusiastically celebrate that great achievement of the reformation are by no means friendly to capitals” p.82

It is not Luther, it is not Protestantism, but the fact that the idea created, the “Calling in the religious sense for worldy conduct were susceptible to quite different interpretations.” p.83

Though this idea of the calling came originally from a divine indifference, in which it wouldn’t matter exactly what you did as long as you didn’t do anything too bad, it eventually developed “a more and more intense belief in divine providence which identified absolute obedience to god’s will, with absolutee acceptance of things as they were.” p.85 “His calling is something which man has to accept as divine ordinance, to which he must adapt himself”

It might have been possible for the calling to change and morph away from portestantism because religious reformers are “not the founders of societies for ethical culture nor the proponents of humanitarian projects for social reform or cultural ideals. The salvation of the soul and that alone was the centre of their life and work. Their ethical ideals and the practical results of their doctrines were all baed on that alone, and were the consequences of purely religious motives.” p.89-90

By studying the calling through the protestant ethic, we can p.90 “form a contribution to the understanding of the manner in which ideas become effective forces in history.” p.91 “we only wish to ascertain whether and to what extent religious forces have taken part in the qualitative formation and the quantitative expansion of that spirit [capitalism] over the world.

Ch.4 - The Religious Foundations of Worldly Ascetism

A. Calvinism
To understand calvanism, you must begin with the virtue of predestination.
Focusing on the dogma on alone can a. tell you what is interesting or valuable in the faith, or b. refer to its influence on other historical processes as a causal factor (99) From these people, it is the idea that you are either graced or you aren’t, and nothing you can do changes either way.

This dogma engendered an “anxious fear of death and the beyond” p.107 that outdid sensuous life, family, etc.

Why might people do something like this?

p108 “The world exists to serve the glorification of gad and for that purpose alone…But god requires social achievement of the christian because he wills that social life shall be organized according to his commencement, in accordance with that purpose…This character is hence shared by labour in a calling which serves the mundane life of the community.”

However, Calvin denies that you can p.110 “learn from the conduct of others whether they are chosen or damned.” However this is what became essentially important. For individuals there are essentially two choices, you can either believe that you are hosen and act that way, or in order to get self confidence intense worldly activity is recommended 111-2.

SO for Lutheranism we have a mystification of the world which makes the concrete world that much more important, and we have this attitude of sin-stained unworthiness maintaining humility and simplicity. FOR calvinists, the feeling of salvation “could only take pale and be perceptible to them in that God worked through them nd that they were conscious of it. That is, their action originated from the faith caused by god’s grace, and this faith in turn justified itself by the quality of that action.” People act the way they do because they know that if they act ungodly at any moment, they will know that they’re damned.

For calvinists, p.119 “The most urgent task the destruction of spontaneous, impulsive enjoyment, the most important means to bring order into the conduct of its adherents.”

p.119-20 “On this methodical control over the whole man rests the enormous expansive power of both, especially the ability of Calvinism as against Luterhanism to defend the cause of Protestantism as the church militant.”

Calvinists would keep books of what people have done as lists of transgressions and goodness with which to tell godlines, just like Franklin used accounting books to focus on morality p124

Ch.5 Ascetism and the Spirit of Capitalism
Baxter, the man of prostestantism/calvanism for the purposes of Weber, focused on “the discussion of wealth and its accusation, on the ebionitic elements of the new testament. Wealth as such is a great danger; its temptations never end and its pursuit is not only senseless…but is morally suspect” p.156/7 “it is only because possession involves this danger of relaxation that it is objectionable at all.

For Protestants, the problem with private property, with a capitalist morality, is that once you’ve made your money you can sit back and do nothing. “Not leisure and enjoyment, but only activity serves to increase the glory of god, according to the definite manifestations of his will.”

Baxter preaches hard labour p.158 “Labour is, on the one hand, an approved ascetic technique, as it always has been in the western church..But the most important thing was that evern beyond that labour came to be considered in itself the end of life, ordained as such by god.”

p.160 “The differentiation of men into the classes and occupations established through historical development became for Luther, as we have seen, a direct result of the divine will. The perseverance of the individual  in the place and within the limits which god had assigned to him was a religious duty.”

HOWEVER for Purtians, “the providential character of the play of private economic interest takes on a somewhat different emphasis…the providential purpose of the diviion of labour is to be known by its fruits.” Baxter argues that ‘outside of a well-marked calling the accomplishments of a man are only casual and irregular” SO It makes sense to be better, to do things better, if it is your calling, than someone who’s calling it isn’t.
 p.162 you can even change your calling “for the purpose of pursuing a calling more pleasing to god, which means, on general principles, one more useful.”

How do you know the usefulness of a calling? “in practice the most important criterion is found in private profitableness.” God shows profit with a purpose. “you may labour to be rich for god, though not for the flesh and sin.”

This fits neatly into the sober, middle class, hard working and self made man. 163’

Part of doing the right thing that is ever more important is formal legality p.165

THE DIRECT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PURITANS AND CAPITALISTS
1. There should be no spontaneous enjoyment. There was a big fight between the puritans and the english king, because england saw puritanism as a threat and allowed for partying on sunday. This meant no sports, no art, no theater, no celebrations.
    1a. This called for great uniformity/no superfluous clothing p.169 “That powerful tendency toward uniformity of life, which today so immensely aids the capitalistic interest in the standardization of production, had its ideal foundations in the repudiations of all idolatry of the flesh.”
     1b. If you really are going to enjoy something, you sure as shit shouldn’t spend money on it. p.170

summary - asceticism “acted powerfully against the spontaneous enjoyent of possessions; it restricted consumption, especially of luxuries. On the other hand, it had the psychological effect of freeing the acquisition of goods from the inhibitions of traditionalistic ethics.” “They set the clean and solid comfort of the middle-class home as an ideal.” p.171

These things together create “accumulation of capital through ascetic compulsion to save.”

These things create an american puritanism, “favored the development of a rational bourgeois economic life; it was the most important, and above all the only consistent influence in the development of that life. It stood at the cradle of the modern economic man.” p. 174

But saving money for too long  the wealth would either be taken by the richer class or, would lead to a breakdown (i guess because everyone is saving and not sepending??) p.174

“IN fact the whole history of monasticism is in a retain sense the history of a continual struggle with the problem of the secularizing influence of wealth.” p.174-5. From a person of the time ‘I fear, wherever riches have increased, the essence of religion has decreased in the same proportion.”This is where charity comess in “those who gain all they can and save all they can should also give all they can, so that they will grow in grace and lay up a treasure in heaven.”176

What protestantism adds to capitalism is the moral force “the psychological sanction of it through the conception of this labour a s a calling, as the best, often in the last analysis the only means of attaining certainty of grace.” p.178”And on the other hand it legalized the exploitation of this specific willingness tow irk, in that it also interpreted the employers business activity as a calling.”

How does puritanism make its way into economic life? p.181 “The puritan wanted to work in a calling; we are forced to do so. For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cells into everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, it did its part in building the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order. This order is now bound tot he technical and economic conditions of machine production which today determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force.”

p.182 “Where the fulfillment of the calling cannot directly be related to the highest spiritual and cultural values, or when, on the other hand, it need not be felt simply as economic compulsion, the individual generally abandons the attempt to justify it at all."
