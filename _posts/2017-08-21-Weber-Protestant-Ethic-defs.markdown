Abstract: This paper argues that current challenges for the sociology of culture are more conceptual and theoretical than methodological in nature. It discusses persistent issues in the conceptualization of culture, the quasi-hierarchic linkages between different cultural elements, and the importance of attention to levels of analysis for the measurement of cultural properties.

The main question is, how do we construct an empirically grounded sociology of culture?

## Conceptual Issues with Studying Culture

Given that a number of ideas are under the umbrella of culture (codes, schemas, etc) we should maybe think of 'culture' as a metaconcept.

If we think of the cultural vs. natural dichotomy, we may think social construct vs naturalistic explanation.  We may also think cultural vs structural. What's the difference?  Perhaps between "sybmolic schemas" and "systems of activity" . We might distinguish between organizational-relational structures and a legal/ideological project.

I am not totally sure what these mean, and what the difference is between these things.

## Theoretical issues

We might think of cultural elements as a spectrum of institutionalization (or taken for grantedness). For instnace, while cultural rules define what a university is, we rarely debate what a university is or if it should exist (kind of).

We may even be able to hierarchically design this culture.  If we think of things as hierarchically, we might see some loose hierarchy in human culture. Try to think of the 'date,' and all of the loose cultural ideas that go into it. Can we lay this out in a way that somehow kind of mirrors a hierarchy?

For Swidler's talk of love,  people keep on changing what 'real love' means while holding onto its concept. There is some hierarchy there, right?


## Measurement Issues
Things are going on at many different levels. Are things global or aggregated? Is the US a "Christian Culture." If you used the constitution, or the speech of the presidents, we might say yes, but if you took a survey of all people and aggregated up, there might be a different answer altogether.

They then lay out three different types of questions about 'culture' in order to understand what is going on:
1. A report of the respondents own preference
2. An assessment of what the respodent thinks others think.
3. An impression of what proper or legitimate opinion on the issue would be.

> Responses to the first item above if aggregated produce a measure of ‘public opinion’ as normally conceived. Answers to the second item produce an indirect measure of one form of ‘collective representation’. Answers to the third produce one measure of ‘norms’. The point is that a level of measurement can address multiple elements (and theoretical levels) of culture. p.367

What they are trying to get at here is that there isn't really a definitive idea of what one should measure or how one should think of culture, there is a wide array of ways that it can be studied.

## Summary
Here is the summary to this short paper:
>This paper stresses four points. The first is simply that the challenges of studying culture have little to do with unique measurement constraints, and more to do with persistent conceptual conflations that hamper our ability to produce consolidated knowledge. The second, related, point is that the implicit reification of the term ‘culture’ into a unitary concept (or even a ‘variable’) is impairing. The term invokes fundamental contrasts of sociology; in that sense it is crucial. Beyond that, one will do better to specify different elements of culture, measure them directly, and consider any quasi-hierarchic linkages that might obtain between them. Our third and fourth points dramatize. levels of analysis. Studying cultural properties requires direct attention to the distinctiveness of different levels of measurement; further, levels of measurement and levels of conceptualization are orthogonal. (If properly treated, data collected at one level of measurement can address different theoretical levels of culture.) In American social science especially, the desire to know culture gets awfully confused with the desire to know minds (Varenne, 1984: 289 and passim; we paraphrase). Thinking in terms of levels of analysis, and about differentiated elements of culture, may push us along.
