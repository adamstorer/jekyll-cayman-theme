<def>What is meant by politics?: The leadership, or the influencing of the leaership, of a political association, hence today, of a state</def>

What is a state?

<def>What does the state have control over?: The use of physical force</def>

Indeed, every state is founded by force.
>When a question is said
to be a 'political' question, when a cabinet minister or an official is said
to be a 'political' official, or when a decision is said to be 'politically'
determined, what is always meant is that interests in the distribution,
maintenance, or transfer of power are decisive for answering the questions
and determining the decision or the official's sphere of activity p.78

States have control over legitimate violence, legitimate domination. There can be traditional domination, charismatic domination, or rational/legal domination.

We are often interested in charismatic domination, where we follow the person because of the charisma as a leader. We believe this person has a calling.

All types of domination require some form of organization, and thus continuous administration. This requires both obedience and the material necessary for the use of physical violence.  

The administrative staff is bound to carrying out the will of the charismatic leader by the possible use of force, as well as personal interest: material reward and social honor.

These things can be called different things depending on where power lies: in a feudal fiefdom, in a state.

<def>Conceptually, what is the modern state: Today, the modern state is a compulsory association which organizes domination. p.82</def>

WE are all sometimes politicans when we do all sorts of stuff like voting or giving a speech or applaouding, and in this way seek to influence the distribution of power within and between political structures.

<def>Politics can be a true vocation in two ways, what are they?: You can live off politics and live for politics, and these are not exclusive.</def>

>Either politics can be conducted 'honorifically' and then, as one usually
says, by 'independent,' that is, by wealthy, men, and especially by
rentiers. Or, political leadership is made accessible to propertyless men
who must then be rewarded. The professional politician who lives 'off
politics may be a pure 'prebendary' or a salaried 'official.' Then the politician
receives either income from fees and perquisites for specific services—
tips and bribes are only an irregular and formally illegal variant
of this category of income—or a fixed income in kind, a money salary,
or both.p.86

The administration of politics falls into two parts, 'political officials', and administrative officials.
<def>Political officials: Can be transferred or dismissed at will at any time.</def>

Journalists are even kind of professional politicians in that they live, but I am actually not totally sure why we're talking about journalists at all here.

In the adminstiration all sorts of people live off of party politics, and these people follow a leader in the hopes that they will be able to live off of politics if they win.   But really the people who ahve a calling for politics are the ones who are these charimsatic leaders, right? at least partially?

>Therefore, today, one cannot yet see in any way how the management
of politics as a 'vocation' will shape itself. Even less can one see
along what avenue opportunities are opening to which political talents
can be put for satisfactory political tasks. He who by his material circumstances
is compelled to live 'off' politics will almost always have to consider
the alternative positions of the journalist or the party official as the
typical direct avenues. Or, he must consider a position as representative
of interest groups—such as a trade union, a chamber of commerce, a farm
bureau,* a craft association,^ a labor board, an employer's association,
et cetera, or else a suitable municipal position. Nothing more than this
can be said about this external aspect: in common with the journalist,
the party official bears the odium of being declasse. 'Wage writer' or
'wage speaker' will unfortunately always resound in his ears, even
though the words remain unexpressed. He who is inwardly defenseless
and unable to find the proper answer for himself had.better stay away
from this career. For in any case, besides grave temptations, it is an
avenue that may constantly lead to disappointments. Now then, what
inner enjoyments can this career offer and what personal conditions are
presupposed for one who enters this avenue? p.11x

>The 'strength' of a political 'personality' means, in the first place, the possession
of these qualities of passion, responsibility, and proportion.



And the last paragraph:
>Politics is a strong and slow boring of hard boards. It takes both passion
and perspective. Certainly all historical experience confirms the truth
—that man would not have attained the possible unless time and again
he had reached out for the impossible. But to do that a man must be a
leader, and not only a leader but a hero as well, in a very sober sense
of the word. And even those who are neither leaders nor heroes must
arm themselves with that steadfastness of heart which can brave even
the crumbling of all hopes. This is necessary right now, or else men
will not be able to attain even that which is possible today. Only he has
the calling for politics who is sure that he shall not crumble when the
world from his point of view is too stupid or too base for what he wants
to offer. Only he who in the face of all this can say 'In spite of all!' has
the calling for politics. p.128

## Notes from Burawoy
Vocation
What does the vocation mean for Weber? There is no single value system. We are specialize. What do we do to give ourselves meaning? What is Weber’s idea of human potentiality?

Politics as a Vocation Has Three Points:
1. Passionate - you have a cause, supposed to inspire others, the charismatic leaders, no guarantees
2. Responsible - against vanity, for the scientist your responsibility is to keep politics out, separation of spheres, faithful to the logic of the thing
3. Sense of Proportions - You can’t be driven by these ideals and not take into account the possibility of realizing them. you have to have some sort of distance/objectivity/realism with your project.


Commitment w/o guarantee depends
on the one hand an autonomy of sphere (SCIENCE - there is a tension between values and facts, we need values to do the research but we can’t let values to effect the researchf)
on the other, a sort of objectivity/realism on the other (POLITICS - ethic of ultimate ends and responsibilities, the passion and cause that will inspire others)

He doesn’t have an idea of a world of critical discourse or a world of public spheres/civil society.
