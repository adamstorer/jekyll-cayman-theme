# Chapter 3 - Personality as a System of Social Action

The social components of action described in Chapter 2 work together to form certain system, such as a personality system.

## Motivations

People have certain drives, or innate tendencies to orient action. Need-dispoistions on the other hand relate to those needs that are not innate.

>We will avoid ad hoc hypotheses
about the amount of biologically determined structuring of drives which
would beg the empirical and conceptual questions of the extent and ways in
which structuring is a need-disposition problem. That is, we will not try to
decide in advance how much the structuring of tendencies is innate and how
much it is a function of the structure and situation of action. p.111

Motivation is some combination of the two. When people strive for something it is the combination of the cognitive and cathectic action oriented towards some motivating object.
