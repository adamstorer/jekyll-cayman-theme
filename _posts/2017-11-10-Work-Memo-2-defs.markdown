The third and fourth weeks of reading focus on the organization of work and its relationship to worker's collective resistance with respect to employers. The question of the organization of work is twofold, as Smith (1997) makes clear in the review of flexible work. Smith argues that there are opposing viewpoints of flexible work, and this is really because flexibility is really understood in two distinct ways: functional flexibility and numerical flexibility. Functional flexibility is seen as somewhat beneficial to the worker. These processes often are meant to involve workers more in the process or production, to take their input into account. This allows for more meaningful work, and therefore workers are less likely to be alienated from their work. However, functional flexibility may also result in more work for certain workers, or higher expectation for production overall. In addition, when work is flexibly organized, individual control is meant to force workers to exert control over each other, making them de-facto managers without an increase in pay. At the same time, a flexible workforce is one in which employers can hire and fire their employees based on momentary need. This is a break from the previous era where workers could expect to remain hired regardless of say, seasonal demand. The duality of the organization of work within the firm and the organization of work within the economy more thoroughly are both represented in this weeks readings to some extent. Kalleberg (2003) studies the different types of nonstandard work relations to make more sense of the increasingly segmented and differentiated workforce.

But at the same time both Kalleberg and Smith find it difficult to separate these two aspects of work. Smith points out that while some workers employment is relatively precarious, other workers in the same workforce are supposed to work longer hours to make up for the loss of more flexible workers. Kalleberg also points out that the different types of labor markets also reflect different organizations of work, and individuals have different sets of problems, and sometimes advantages, depending on which labor segment of the labor market they are participating in. For instance, independent contractors are generally in charge of organizing their own work and are quite happy, and even though they have nonstandard work agreements, they are different people and have different problems than those who work for Temp Agencies, where there is a triangular set of social relations between the agency, the hiring company, and the individual worker. Each segment of the labor market organizes work differently both in the labor market and general trends within the organization.

Though there is differentiation within flexible word, the overall trend of flexible work could be interpreted as the newest phase in the organization of work practices. As Edwards (1978) shows, the ways in which employers deal with workers must address worker's direction, evaluation, and discipline. While Edwards study shows how technical and bureaucratic control come together to form a new system of control in the mid twentieth century, it is perhaps the case that numerical and functional flexibility are the new two regimes which deal with this same issue.

While some are happy to identify specific eras of work, others are much more apprehensive. I partially share this concern, particularly after reading a few accounts of labor history. Edwards (1978), Jacoby (1985) and Braverman (1974) deal with much of the same historical data while drawing different conclusions. The conclusions themselves are Detailed study of In order to understand how systems of control and eras of work
