The book is about the people who fully accept the organization as their purpose. is this separate from the bureaucrat? Are these really separable scales that Weber should have distinguished between?

This is not necessarily just the corporation man - the person focused particularly on the business - The person getting a PhD, the seminary student. These are people who dedicate themselves to some organized fashion of social life such that it seeps into every aspect of their being.

>Let me now define my terms, by social ethic I mean that contemporary body of thought
which makes morally legitimate the pressures of society against the individual. Its major
propositions are three: a belief in the group as the source of creativity; a belief in
“belongingness” as the ultimate need of the individual; and a belief in the application of
science to achieve the belongingness. p.18-19

Here is the overall sense of the argument that the organization man believes in, i.e. the kind of social ethic:

>Man exists as a unit of society. Of himself, he is
isolated, meaningless; only as he collaborates with others does he become worth while, for
by sublimating himself in the group, he helps produce a whole that is greater than the sum
of its parts. There should be, then, no conflict between man and society. What we think are
conflicts are misunderstandings, breakdowns in communication. By applying the methods
of science to human relations we can eliminate these obstacles to consensus and create an
equilibrium in which society’s needs and the needs of the individual are one and the same. p.19

Somehow we worship organizations when we really shouldn't.

# Decline of the Protestant Ethic

The protestant ethic was optimistic, getting people to work in the world and helping everyone prove their lot in doing so.

>As organizations continued to expand, the protestant ethic became more and more
divergent from the reality The Organization was itself creating. The managers steadfastly
denied the change, but they, as much as those they led, were affected by it. Today, some
still deny the inconsistency or blame it on creeping socialism; for the younger generation
of managers however, the inconsistencies have become importuning...The same man
who will quote from Benjamin Franklin on thrift for the house organ would be horrified if
consumers took these maxims to heart and started putting more money into savings and
less into installment purchases. p.25

From the standpoint of the organization, the economic imperatives stand against the protestant ethic. The organization man has to persuade people not to feel guilty about buying things.

# Scientism

Three things came together to put the social ethic over the protestant ethic. Scientism is one of them:

>The first denominator is scientism. This is the practical part of the Social Ethic, for it is the
promise that with the same techniques that have worked in the physical sciences we can
eventually create an exact science of man.* In one form or another, it has had a long and
dismal record of achievement; even its proponents readily admit that the bugs are
appalling. But this has not shaken the faith in scientism, for it is essentially a Utopian
rather than a technical idea.

The other two things are belongingness and togetherness. I am skipping this part and moving to a different part.


This book is kind of hard to follow and seems to be very loosely argued BS.

# The Training of Organization Man

## A Generation of Bureaucrats

People don't worry about leaving college any more, they easily transfer to the corporation. These people are happy to accept the status quo. People don't want to be entrepreneur's even. They just want to work at a big corporation, and for life.

>In turning their back on the protestant ethic they are consistent; if they do not cherish
venture, neither do they cherish what in our lore was its historic reward. They are without
avarice. p.61

Some people even turn down more money to work at a smaller company

In the next chapter he argues that:

>a large part of the U.S. educational
system is preparing people badly for the organization society—precisely because it is
trying so very hard to do it. My charge rests on the premise that what the organization man
needs most from education is the intellectual armor of the fundamental disciplines. It is
indeed an age of group action, of specialization, but this is all the more reason the
organization man does not need the emphases of a training “geared for modern man.” The
pressures of organization life will teach him that. But they will not teach him what the
schools and colleges can—some kind of foundation, some sense of where we came from,
so that he can judge where he is, and where he is going and why.

I get it, but I'm not sure I need to read any more from what seems more and more to be the rambling of a grumpy old man.
