Abstract: "The authors investigate the relationship between family policy and
women’s attachment to the labor market, focusing specifically on policy
feedback on women’s subjective work commitment. They utilize
a quasi-experimental design to identify normative policy effects from
changes in mothers’ work commitment in conjunction with two policy
changes that significantly extended the length of statutory parental
leave entitlements in Germany. Using unique survey data fromthe
German Socio-Economic Panel and difference-in-differences, tripledifferenced,
and instrumental variables estimators for panel data, they
obtain consistent empirical evidence that increasing generosity of leave
entitlements led to a decline in mothers’ work commitment in both
East and West Germany. They also probe potential mediating mechanisms
and find strong evidence for role exposure and norm setting
effects. Finally, they demonstrate that policy-induced shifts in mothers’
preferences have contributed to retarding women’s labor force
participation after childbirth in Germany, especially as far as mothers’
return to full-time employment is concerned."

There is a relationship between family policies and women's labor market success that economic theory does not account for - particularly adverse effects of long parental levae entitlements.

One idea is that statistical discrimination happens when less women show up, especially when policies double down on gender divisions.
>Another, perhaps even more fundamentally sociological mechanism
is highlighted in a body of recent work that emphasizes welfare states
as reflecting but also shaping the moral economy of modern societies, where
citizens’ belief systems are inherently affected by those norms that are institutionalized
in and legitimized by public policy environments p.3

>What is more, the results of the researchwe report here strongly suggest that
such policy effects have not been restricted to purely behavioral change in
response to changing economic incentives but have also comprised normative
feedback effects on mothers’ subjective work commitment p.5

>Instead, adopting a socialization perspective implies an emphasis on the
fundamental relevance of learning from experience and information, which,
although surely shaped by and contingent on earlier formative experiences
during adolescence, is unlikely to discontinue at later stages in the life course
ðsee Parsons ½1951 and, more recently, Kohn ½1977, 1989, Bolzendahl and
Myers ½2004, Brooks and Bolzendahl ½2004, and Elder and Shanahan
½2006Þ.p.6

It might be key lifecourse changes the ways people think more.
>Effectively, the central tenet of any exposure model
of preference formation is that exposure to novel circumstances and conditions
will trigger a certain extent of corresponding preference adaptation,
so that work-oriented events and life course transitions should in general engender
attitudinal change toward more work-oriented preferences, whereas
family-oriented transitions should have the opposite effect p.6

The idea is, the more time you spend off of work the more personal satisfaction you get out of motherhood, and as a result you no longer get as much satisfactino out of work.

The idea then is that there can be a ind of "normative policy feedback" - if the policy is built on an idea and then we get the experience based on this idea, then we will see things even more like before.

>In other words, the more generous
parental leave entitlements become, the more negative the impact of
motherhood on women’s subjective work commitment because extended
leave entitlements tend to increase mothers’ time off work p.8

If this creates a cultural shift, it may change the opinions of women who do not even change their work habits.

They're doing this in east and west germany so that you can see like-ish peple and policy shifts.

In 2007, we see Germany change it's parental leave entitlement to 1 year paid family leave, and women tend to use the full amount here.

We then ask people normative questions to get at work commitment which get at the centrality of the work role as a source of intrinsic satisfaction.


This is a good paper which asks many questions that I'm interested in and demonstrates the workload that is necessary for a paper like this to succeed - many many empirical outcomes.
