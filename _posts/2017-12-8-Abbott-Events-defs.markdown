Abstract
>This article reviews new and rigorous methods for analyzing narrative data and over-time data more generally. It locates these new methods within a general turn away from the “variables paradigm.”

Narrative could be a good way of making sense of things in terms of story. Usually we parse social reality into bits and think about how bits interact rather than individuals. Usually sociology ignores process completely.

## What about process?

They were central to Weber and Marx and even Parsons/Goffman. Now we have rational choice but some think it's unsociological.

At the same time, causality has a strange history in sociology. The dominant thing now, before it was unclear. Hume had a hard time believing in causality and others also had trouble.

But then more statistics showed up which led sociologists down a path of causation which limited their ability to think carefully about this stuff.

Here are the assumptions of traditional sociology:
1. The social world is made up of fixed entities with varying attributes
1a. Some attributes determine/cause others
2. What happens to one case doesn't constrain what happesn to others, spatially or temporally.
3. Attributes have one and only one causal meaning within a given study.
4. Attributes determine each other pincipally as independent scales rathen than as constellations of attributes - main effects are more important than interactions.

There are some other assumption implicit assumptions involving time and tmeporality. These are the narrative positivism assumptions;
5. Things happen in discrete bits of uniform length and are not aggregated into overlapping "events" of varying length.
5a. In cases where one must consider differential duration of attributes, deteermination flows from long duration attributes to shorter duration ones, from context to individual.
6. The order in which attributes change does not influence what changes occur; all cases follow the same causal narrative or model.

All methodologies have the following:
1. an ontology (assumption 1)
2. A theory of structure (assumption 2)
3. A theory of causality (Assumptions 3, 4, and 5a)
4. A concept of time (Assumptions 5 and 6)

There are a few narrative assumptions that Abbott has made that differs from the standard account:
1. Enchainment - the narrative link from one step to the next
2. Whether a story presupposes a particular order of events.
3. Convergence - The degree to which a social sequence approached a steady state.

Abbott calls people's indvidual histories something like "entity processes."  

## How do you study narratives?

### modeling
Event-History analysis is somewher in the middle

Game theory also has some of this.

They tend to fall apart though and break some of the assumptions ot provilige others.

## Formal Description

They focus on an inherent logic of events rather than a transcendent logic of causal variables. Event structure analysis and comparative narrative analysis do some kind of formal mepping of an event.   

## Empirical Categorization

This is the Abbott method:
It is a flexible methodology not commited to any specific level. This I think is something like optimalmatching, which is seeing how similar peple's trajectories play out.
