## Notes on Italian History

Gramsci is studying Risorgimento - something I'm not totally clear on, and discusses the passive revolutions. Gramsci discusses passive revolution as a revolution without mass participation, or as a molecular transformation which takes place beneath the surface of society.

### HIstory of the Subaltern Classes

The history of the ruling class is essentially the history of the state. This is a kind of historical unity between political society and civil society. Subaltern classes are not unified and do not unite. They are the other groups in civil society. We should study the formation and diffusion of these groups, and their affilaition with dominant political foramtions. This study must include repercussions of the activity of these groups.

If we look to see how subaltern groups become dominant, we have to understand how they acquired autonomy from other groups and support from other groups.

>Subaltern groups are
always subject to the activity of ruling groups, even when they rebel and
rise up: only “permanent” victory breaks their subordination, and that
not immediately. In reality, even when they appear triumphant, the
subaltern groups are merely anxious to defend themselves (a truth which
can be demonstrated by the history of the French Revolution at least up
to 1830). Every trace of independent initiative on the part of subaltern
groups should therefore be of incalculable value for the integral historian.
Consequently, this kind of history can only be dealt with monographically,
and each monograph requires an immense quantity of
material which is often hard to collect p.207

### Problem of Political Leadership

So we start with the different politicl relationships surrounding risorgimento. Here it is:
1. The moderates -  a homogenous social group
2. Action party - not based in a historical class, instead based in its following but minor differentiation from the moderates.  - Steeped in the traditional rhetoric of italian literature.

The moderates supremacy over the action party takes two forms:
1. Domination
2. Intellectual and moral leadership. p.212

The problem is that they must form groups that unite intellectuals and the masses in some meaningful way, while dealing with how different parties react to one another.
The moderates lead the action party

>It seems clear from the policies of the Moderates that
there can, and indeed must, be hegemonic activity even before the rise
to power, and that one should not count only on the material force
which power gives in order to exercise an effective leadership. It was
precisely the brilliant solution of these problems which made the
Risorgimento possible, in the form in which it was achieved (and with its
limitations)—-as “revolution” without a “revolution”, or as “passive
revolution” to use an expression of Cuoco’s in a slightly different sense
from that which Cuoco intended p.215


Gramsci explains the roel fo intellectuals in both settings, but what I don't understand as of yet is why there were two groups at all. I guess one reason might be with the liberal catholic party, who seemed to be on the side of the moderates by pushing the Papacy too far to the left or to the right.

There is a power that we see here - a power of spontaneous action.
The action body then was "always, more than anything else, an agitational and propagandist body in the service of the Moderates." p.220

There is some relationship between the parties and the intellectual work that the party is founded in.
Another figure that needs to be studied is Giuseppe Ferrari, a thinker. he created occasional pamphlets and letters that sometimes motivated individuals.

There is some similarity between the French case, where the Jacobins united town and country, and the Italian setting for the Action Party, which is perhaps the more intellectual radical party. Gramsci is concerned with an intellectual history here to help, I guess, understand the role of intellectuals in all of this, but I'm not totally sure where he's going..

There was a lot at stake with respect to the unity of Italy, Something that another famous intellectual, Crispi, worked on to some extent.

Here is where we end from the strange intellectual history:
>From this series of observations and analyses of certain elements of
Italian history after unity, certain criteria may be drawn for evaluating
the position of confrontation between the Moderates and the Action
Party, and for investigating the respective political “wisdom” of these
two parties and of the various tendencies which contested the political
and ideological leadership of the latter of them p.239

1. To counterpose the Moderates, the Action Party should have allied itself with a notion of Unity in all aspects of society. This would align the peasant masses and the intellectuals. There needs to be some national liberal idea because: a. If the peasants move too fast or too spontaneoulsy the intellectuals waiver. On the other hand, if the intellectualls can situate themselves with pro peasant policies, it draws even more of the masses.

>However, one may say
that, given the dispersal and the isolation of the rural population and
hence the difficulty of welding it into solid organisations, it is best to
start the movement from the intellectual groups; however, in general, it
is the dialectical relation between the two actions which has to be kept
in mind. It may also be said that peasant parties in the strict sense of
the word are almost impossible to create. The peasant party generally is
achieved only as a strong current of opinion, and not in schematic forms
of bureaucratic organisation. p. 240

Ferrari, the action party's specialist did not heed this advice.
In 1848 the Moderates formed a national bloc which influenced the Action Party's main thinkers, Mazzini and Garibaldi.

The political and military leadership can be understood not as two separate questions but as two similar questions.

>Consequently, the military problem was the following: how to succeed in
mobilising an insurrectional force which was capable not only of
expelling the Austrian army from the peninsula, but of preventing it from
being able to come back with a counter-offensive—given the fact that
the violent expulsion would endanger the complex structure of the
Empire, and hence would galvanise all the forces interested in its
cohesion for a reconquest. p. 256

That is - as the revolution was being fought against the Austrians, Italy had a saying that "Italy Will Go it Alone" and this prevented other countries, like France, from wanting to come and join in. There needs to be some cooperation between the military and politics as such.

## The Concept of Passive Revolution

There are two fundamental principles of political science from which Passive Revolution can come:
1. No social formation disappears as long as the productive forces which have developed wihin it still find room for forther forward movement.
2. A society does not set itself tasks for whose solution the necessary conditions have not already been incubated.

These ideas are particularly important with respect to three momemnts of a situation.
1.
2. Equilibrium of political forces
3. Politico-Military Equilibrium

And ther eis a question about the relationship between a war of position and passive revolution. 	There are essentially two things, a war of menoeuvre and a ware of position. I don't really understand exactly what these concepts mean.

There is a historical example here where I have really very little that I understand.

Passive revolution is in part based on the relationship between objective and subjective conditions.

This section really got away from me.

>Yet the
conception remains a dialectical one—in other words, presupposes,
indeed postulates as necessary, a vigorous antithesis which can present
intransigently all its potentialities for development. Hence theory of the
“passive revolution” not as a programme, as it was for the Italian liberals
of the Risorgimento, but as a criterion of interpretation, in the absence of
other active elements to a dominant extent np.301

What is the story of passive revolution with respect to the Risorgimento, and the Moderates/Action party? I'm not sure I could tell you here.

## The History of Europe seen as Passive Revolution.
How can we understand the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars within the context of a passive revolution.

>the
period of restoration-revolution, in which the demands which in France
found a Jacobin-Napoleonic expression were satisfied by small doses,
legally, in a reformist manner—in such a way that it was possible to
preserve the political and economic position of the old feudal classes, to
avoid agrarian reform, and, especially, to avoid the popular masses
going through a period of political experience such as occurred in France
in the years of Jacobinism, in 1831, and in 1848 p.309

Perhaps this is as clear a revolution s we see - that the moderates can drive the action party in such a way as to remain in power and preserve the old way of life.  With respect to Italian Fascism:
>The ideological hypothesis
could be presented in the following terms: that there is a passive
revolution involved in the fact that—through the legislative intervention
of the State, and by means of the corporarive organisation—relatively
far-reaching modifications are being introduced into the country’s
economic structure in order to accentuate the “plan of production”
element; in other words, that socialisation and co-operation in the
sphere of production are being increased, without however touching (or
at least not going beyond the regulation and control of) individual and
group appropriation of profit. p.310

A war of position then, might be a war in which nothing is actually done about the things people care about.

>What is important from the
political and ideological point of view is that it is capable of creating—
and indeed does create—a period of expectation and hope, especially in
certain Italian social groups such as the great mass of urban and rural
petit bourgeois. It thus reinforces the hegemonic system and the forces
of military and civil coercion at the disposal of the traditional ruling classes.
	This ideology thus serves as an element of a “war of position” in the
international economic field (free competition and free exchange here
corresponding to the war of movement), just as “passive revolution” does
in the political field. In Europe from 1789 to 1870 there was a
(political) war of movement in the French Revolution and a long war of
position from 1815 to 1870. In the present epoch, the war of
movement took place politically from March 1917 to March 1921; this
was followed by a war of position whose representative—both practical
(for Italy) and ideological (for Europe)—is fascism. [1935] p.310-311


## Part II, Section 1—The Modern Prince (123-205) - p.313 - 441

### Brief Notes on Machiavelli's Politics

The prince is a live work, not a utopian work or a scholarly treatise, but a real treatment of how to do things ina myth like setting. There are utopian characteristics - for instance no historicim here, but it is base don something that should really exist.

>In the conclusion, Machiavelli merges with the people,
becomes the people; riot, however, some “generic” people, but the
people whom he, Machiavelli, has convinced by the preceding
argument—the people whose consciousness and whose expression he
becomes and feels himself to be, with whom he feels identified. The
entire “logical” argument now appears as nothing other than autoreflection
on the part of the people—an inner reasoning worked out in
the popular consciousness, whose conclusion is a cry of passionate
urgency. The passion, from discussion of itself, becomes once again
“emotion”, fever, fanatical desire for action. This is why the epilogue of
The Prince is not something extrinsic, tacked on, rhetorical, but has to
be understood as a necessary element of the work—indeed as the
element which gives the entire work its true colour, and makes it a kind
of “political manifesto”.  p.319

>The modern prince, the myth-prince, cannot be a real person, a
concrete individual. It can only be an organism, a complex element of
society in which a collective will, which has already been recognised and
has to some extent asserted itself in action, begins to take concrete form.
History has already provided this organism, and it is the political party— p. 323

In other words, the prince is not a myth, it is not utopian, when we consider the prince to be not an individual but a political party. Considering the modern prince, we must consider the French revolutionaries the Jacobins. Consider the following quest:
When can the conditions for awakening and developing a national-popular collective will be said to exist.

>All history from 1815 onwards shows
the efforts of the traditional classes to prevent the formation of a
collective will of this kind, and to maintain “economic-corporate” power
in an international system of passive equilibrium p. 328

The collective will would be a reform of the militia and its particular culture. So we end with two basic points that the modern prince must attend to by both organising and activating.
1. The formation of a national-popular collective will
2. INtellectual and moral reform.

A modern prince must pose these two things dramatically, not in a cold academic style.

Gramsci argues that the modern prince must combine economic reform with intellectual and moral reform.

### Machiavelli and Marx

We know there is no abstract human nature, but only a historically determined set of social relations.

For Machiavelli, he teaches that one must act coldly and calculating, and they all do but some deny it and some are too obvious about it.

>This position in which Machiavelli found himself politically is
repeated today for the philosophy of praxis. Once more there is the
necessity to be “anti-Machiavellian”, to develop a theory and technique
of politics which—however strong the belief that they will in the final
resort be especially useful to the side which was “not in the know”,
since that is where the historically progressive force is to be found—
might be useful to both sides in the struggle. In actual fact, one
immediate result is achieved, in that the unity based on traditional
ideology is broken; p. 335

I am not totally sure how Marx plays into this section other than to say that Marx-style revolutions require a Machiavellian notion of how the game of politics is played.

### Politics as an Autonomous Science

>distincts. In a
philosophy of praxis, the distinction will certainly not be between the
moments of the absolute Spirit, but between the levels of the
superstructure. The problem will therefore be that of establishing the
dialectical position of political activity (and of the corresponding science)
as a particular level of the superstructure. One might say, as a first
schematic approximation, that political activity is precisely the first
moment or first level; the moment in which the superstructure is still in
the unmediated phase of mere wishful affirmation, confused and still at
an elementary stage. p. 337

That is, Gramsci is struggling with the relationship between Politics and Economics.
If we look at the history of machiavelli studies as a history of political science, we see that noone has really taken down machiavelli. Those who opposed him were really just politicians opposing Machiavellis stances, while the theory remains.

### Elements of Politics

What are the first elements of politics?
1. There really do exist rules and ruled, leaders and led.
Given this fact, how can one lead most effectively, and how can one find resistance.

There is a fundamental premise - shoudl there always be rulers and ruled or should there be objective conditions in which we no longer need this division. And does there need to be automatic following in your own group against another group?

Parties are the most effective way of developing leaders and leadership.

When one acts, they act with a kind of state spirit. State spirit presupposes a kind of continuity with the past.

### The Political Party

In a political party, the leader leans on the party to carry out their ideas.
In a totalitarian party, the division between the government and the political party disappear. ONe can also think of a newspaper as part of a political party.

Usually the masses, the lead, are "kept happy by means of moralising sermons" rather than in actual changes. p.357

In writing the history of the party, it has to be about how it brought some mass together, but there is a lot to be said for the made up moralising in the history of the party.

>When does a party become historically necessary? When the
conditions for its “triumph”, for its inevitable progress to State power,
are at least in the process of formation, and allow their future
evolution—all things going normally—to be foreseen. p.359

When can the party not be stopped by normal means?  Three fundamental elements have to converge:
1. A mass group who is loyal to the party
2. A principle cohesive element brings together forces that would not be together otherwise.
3. An intermediate element which maintains contact between the first two.  

There is also a policing function that keeps people in line -
>The policing function of
a party can hence be either progressive or regressive. It is progressive
when it tends to keep the dispossessed reactionary forces within the
bounds of legality, and to raise the backward masses to the level of the
new legality. It is regressive when it tends to hold back the vital forces of
history and to maintain a legality which has been superseded, which is
anti-historical, which has become extrinsic p. 364

### Conceptions of the World and Practice Stances: Global and Partial

I.e., does some political action see themselves as fixing some isolated or independent aspect of collective life, or are there global changes that effect an integrated world.

Many parties are merely reformist.

>This principle has political importance, because the theoretical truth
that every class has a single party is demonstrated, at the decisive
turning-points, by the fact that various groupings, each of which had up
till then presented itself as an “independent” party, come together to
form a united bloc. p.368

The independent groups before were mreely reformist, but when the come together in a bloc they have a monolithic, global characters. This usually comes  over a long period of time tied to understanding that everything is made up.

### Some Theoretical and Practical Aspects of Economism
Economism was a separation of the workers and the liberals and intellectuals, put in contrast to a party that united them.

This is a critique of Laissez faire -

>Thus it is asserted that economic activity belongs to civil
society, and that the State must not intervene to regulate it. But since in
actual reality civil society and State are one and the same, it must be
made clear that laissez-faire too is a form of State “regulation”,
introduced and maintained by legislative and coercive means. It is a
deliberate policy, conscious of its own ends, and not the spontaneous,
automatic expression of economic facts. Consequently, laissez-faire
liberalism is a political programme, designed to change—in so far as it is
victorious—a State’s leading personnel, and to change the economic
programme of the State itself—in other words the distribution of the
national income. p.371

The idea, I think, is that in general not doing anything is doing something - it is allowing a certain class to dominate. Characteristics of historical economism -
1. It makes no distinction between what is permanent and what is fluctuating. No class formations.
2. Economic development is reduced to the course of technical change in the instruments of work.
3. History is built with respect to some element of production

This is a more developed critique than Marx, and not a critique of historical materialism.
>In pure Marxism, men taken as a mass obey economic
necessity and not their own emotions. Politics is emotion; patriotism is
emotion; these two imperious goddesses merely act as a façade in
history. In reality, the history of peoples throughout the centuries is to be
explained by a changing, constantly renewed interplay of material
causes. Everything is economics p. 377

Economism does not do the follwoing
>When a movement of the
Boulangist type occurs, the analysis realistically should be developed
along the following lines: 1. social content of the mass following of the
movement; 2. what function did this mass have in the balance of
forces—which is in process of transformation, as the new movement
demonstrates by its very coming into existence? 3. what is the political
and social significance of those of the demands presented by the
movement’s leaders which find general assent? To what effective needs
do they correspond? 4. examination of the conformity of the means to
the proposed end; 5. only in the last analysis, and formulated in political
not moralistic terms, is the hypothesis considered that such a movement
will necessarily be perverted, and serve quite different ends from those
which the mass of its followers expect p.382


### Prediction and Perspective
There is the dual perspective in political action and in national life, which can show up on many levels, but at the lowest level this can be reduced to human nature, that people are really half-animal and half-human?  

>In actual fact, it often happens that the more the first
“perspective” is “immediate” and elementary, the more the second has
to be “distant” (not in time, but as a dialectical relation), complex and
ambitious. In other words, it may happen as in human life, that the
more an individual is compelled to defend his own immediate physical
existence, the more will he uphold and identify with the highest values
of civilisation and of humanity, in all their complexity p. 388

How do you do prediction? Can there be objective prediction?
>Anybody who makes a prediction has in fact a “programme” for whose
victory he is working, and his prediction is precisely an element
contributing to that victory. p. 388

>A distinction must be made not only between “diplomat” and
“politician”, but also between political scientist and active politician. The
diplomat inevitably will move only within the bounds of effective reality,
since his specific activity is not the creation of some new equilibrium,
but the maintenance of an existing equilibrium within a certain juridical
framework. Similarly, the political scientist has to keep within the
bounds of effective reality in so far as he is merely a scientist. But
Machiavelli is not merely a scientist: he is a partisan, a man of powerful
passions, an active politician, who wishes to create a new balance of
forces and therefore cannot help concerning himself with what “ought to
be” (not of course in a moralistic sense). Hence the question cannot be
posed in these terms, it is more complex. It is one, that is to say, of
seeing whether what “ought to be” is arbitrary or necessary; whether it is
concrete will on the one hand or idle fancy, yearning, daydream on the
other.  p. 390

### Economic-Corporate Phase of the State

This section is just a critique of another writer that does not go into much detail about any actual opinions. I didn't get anything out of it.

### Analysis of Situations. Relations of Force

How do we understand situations and the forces that propel action.

>It is the problem of the relations between structure and superstructure
which must be accurately posed and resolved if the forces which are
active in the history of a particular period are to be correctly analysed,
and the relation between them determined

What orients discussion?
1. No society sets itself tasks for whose accomplishment the conditions do not already exist.
2. No society breaks down and can be replaced unitl it has first developed all the forms of life which are implicit in its internal relations.

This take, like Marx, is probably a little overly-Hegelian.

Often times structural problems are revealed but political forces want to keep things as is. Sometimes it is hard to suss out what structurally is happening vs  what people are trying to make happen politically. This is called the relation between organic movement (movements that play out because of the way the structure of social relations exist) and conjuctural moments (band aid type moments.)

When understanding the relations of forces, we get the following levels. This is extremeley important. p.405!!

1. A relation of social forces which is closely linked to the structure,
objective, independent of human will, and which can be measured with
the systems of the exact or physical sciences. The level of development
of the material forces of production provides a basis for the emergence of
the various social classes, each one of which represents a function and
has a specific position within production itself.
2. A subsequent moment is the relation of political forces; in other
words, an evaluation of the degree of homogeneity, self-awareness, and
organisation attained by the various social classes. This moment can in
its turn be analysed and differentiated into various levels, corresponding
to the various moments of collective political consciousness, as they
have manifested themselves in history up till now. The first and most
elementary of these is the economic-corporate level: a tradesman feels
obliged to stand by another tradesman, a manufacturer by another
manufacturer, etc., but the tradesman does not yet feel solidarity with
the manufacturer; in other words, the members of the professional group
are conscious of its unity and homogeneity, and of the need to organise
it, but in the case of the wider social group this is not yet so. A second
moment is that in which consciousness is reached of the solidarity of
interests among all the members of a social class—but still in the purely
economic field...
3. A third moment is that in which one becomes
aware that one’s own corporate interests, in their present and future
development, transcend the corporate limits of the purely economic
class, and can and must become the interests of other subordinate
groups too. This is the most purely political phase, and marks the
decisive passage from the structure to the sphere of the complex
superstructures; it is the phase in which previously germinated
ideologies become “party”, come into confrontation and conflict, until
only one of them, or at least a single combination of them, prevails
The third moment is that of the relation of military forces, which
from time to time is directly decisive. Here too, two levels can be
distinguished: the military level in the strict or technical military sense,
and the level which may be termed politico-military

One may also ask if theI don't think so  economy must really be the determinate factor -
>Changes can come about either because a
situation of well-being is threatened by the narrow self-interest of a rival
class, or because hardship has become intolerable and no force is visible
in the old society capable of mitigating it and of re-establishing normality
by legal means. Hence it may be said that all these elements are the
concrete manifestation of the conjunctural fluctuations of the totality of
social relations of force, on whose terrain the passage takes place from
the latter to political relations of force, and finally to the military relation
which is decisive p. 410

### On Bureaucracy
>However, though it is true that every new form
of society and State has required a new type of functionary, it is also
true that new ruling groups have never been able, at least initially, to
ignore tradition or established interests—i.e. the categories of
functionary (especially in the ecclesiastical and military spheres) who
already existed and had been constituted before they came to power. p.413

There is some stuff on democratic and organic centralism - I am not really getting it.

>Democratic centralism is “organic”
because on the one hand it takes account of movement, which is the
organic mode in which historical reality reveals itself, arid does not
solidify mechanically into bureaucracy; and because at the same time it
takes account of that which is relatively stable and permanent, or which
at least moves in an easily predictable direction, etc. This element of
stability within the State is embodied in the organic development of the
leading group’s central nucleus, just as happens on a more limited scale
within parties. The prevalence of bureaucratic centralism in the State
indicates that the leading group is saturated, that it is turning into a
narrow clique which tends to perpetuate its selfish privileges by
controlling or even by stifling the birth of oppositional forces—even if
these forces are homogeneous with the fundamental dominant interests p. 417

I think this amounts to a critique of Weber's bureaucracy, because whereas Weber sees things playing out in a specific way due to certain circumastances (specialized knowledge) Gramsci sees the negative aspects of bureaucracy as the result of specific actions by rulign groups.
>In any case, it needs to be stressed that the unhealthy manifestations
of bureaucratic centralism occurred because of a lack of initiative and
responsibility at the bottom, in other words because of the political
immaturity of the peripheral forces, p. 417

>This continuous effort to separate
out the “international” and “unitary” element in national and local reality
is true concrete political action, the sole activity productive of historical
progress. It requires an organic unity between theory and practice,
between intellectual strata and popular masses, between rulers and
ruled. The formulae of unity and federation lose a great part of their
significance from this point of view, whereas they retain their sting in the
bureaucratic conception, where in the end there is no unity but a
stagnant swamp, on the surface calm and “mute”, and no federation but
a “sack of potatoes”,86 i.e. a mechanical juxtaposition of single “units” without any connectionb etween them. 418-9

THat is, politics and structure drive social relations, bureaucracy and modernization do not get us there.

### The Theorem of Fixed Proportions

The idea is that there is an optimum amount of each type of thing in a society and that too much of one will mess it up.

There are some ohter sections with short ideas - for instance, there is no pure spantaneity, leadership always plays a role. Can people develop spontaneous reactions that are different from their objective positions? Probalh not. but I don't see why not.

There is the notion of the collective worker in a factory, and the statement that this is a transitory construction.

There is a section on volunteers

##Part II, Section 2—State and Civil Society (206-275) p. 445 - 556
>in the specific
case of the fascist régime in Italy, the problem, in Gramsci’s eyes, is 1.
to analyse the “passive revolution” which fascism perhaps represents,
and 2. to analyse the specificity of the social forces which produced it—
i.e. rejecting absolutely the crude equation fascism = capitalism. p.445

### Structure of Political Parties in Periods of Organic Crisis

Sometimes classes become detached from their political party.
>When
such crises occur, the immediate situation becomes delicate and
dangerous, because the field is open for violent solutions, for the
activities of unknown forces, represented by charismatic “men of
destiny”. p.450

I think what we've learned is that, perhaps, class does not have to dictate politics.

The ruling class in times of crisis can often make sense of things more quickly, accept some minor defeats and continue to have power.

>The passage of
the troops of many different parties under the banner of a single party,
which better represents and resumes the needs of the entire class, is an
organic and normal phenomenon, even if its rhythm is very swift—
indeed almost like lightning in comparison with periods of calm. It
represents the fusion of an entire social class under a single leadership,
which alone is held to be capable of solving an overriding problem of its
existence and of fending off a mortal danger. p. 451

There is a role for bureaucrats and the military, in addition to the party and the true structure of social relations, and one must try and determine the role of all 4.  

### Caesarism

What is caesarism? A great heroic personality, similar to a charismatic leader in Weber.

>Caesarism can be said to express a situation in which the forces in
conflict balance each other in a catastrophic manner; that is to say, they
balance each other in such a way that a continuation of the conflict can
only terminate in their reciprocal destruction. When the progressive force
A struggles with the reactionary force B, not only may A defeat B or B
defeat A, but it may happen that neither A nor B defeats the other—that
they bleed each other mutually and then a third force C intervenes from
outside, subjugating what is left of both A and B. In Italy, after the death
of Lorenzo il Magnifico, this is precisely what occurred p. 463

Caesarism can be progressive - when it helps the progressive force triumph (though there are more limitations) or reactionary when it helps the reactionary force triumph.

Trump, then, is a reactionary caesarism.

>It would be an error of method (an aspect of sociological mechanicism)
to believe that in Caesarism—whether progressive, reactionary,
or of an intermediate and episodic character—the entire new historical
phenomenon is due to the equilibrium of the “fundamental” forces. It is
also necessary to see the interplay of relations between the principal
groups (of various kinds, socio-economic and technical-economic) of the
fundamental classes and the auxiliary forces directed by, or subjected to,
their hegemonic influence. p. 468

### Fable of the Beaver

The fable is that beavers bite their balls off to save their lives because hunters will kell them for their vanilla balls. This passage is hard to follow, I'm nottotally sure what's going on.

One aspect...
>This system of relations meant that
the party had no concrete existence as an independent organism, but
merely as one constitutive element of a more complex organism which
had all the characteristics of a labour party—without a centre, without
any unitary will, etc. Must the unions therefore be subordinated to the
party? This is not the right way to pose the question. The problem must
be posed in the following terms: every member of the party, whatever
his position or his responsibilities, is still a member of the party and
subordinate to its leadership. There cannot be subordination between
union and party: if the union has spontaneously chosen as its leader a
member of the party, that means that the union freely accepts the
directives of the party, hence freely accepts (indeed desires) control by
the party over its officials. This problem was not posed correctly in
1919, although there existed a great and instructive precedent, that of
June 1914.22 For in reality, the fractions had no policy, and hence
neither did the party. [ p. 475

### Agitation and Propaganda

The weakness in italy is an imbalance of agitation and propganda.

>etc. The principal
reason why the parties are like this is to be sought in the deliquescence
of the economic classes, in the gelatinous economic and social structure
of the country—but this explanation is somewhat fatalistic. In fact, if it is
true that parties are only the nomenclature for classes, it is also true that
parties are not simply a mechanical and passive expression of those
classes, but react energetically upon them in order to develop, solidify
and universalise them. This precisely did not occur in Italy, and the
result of this “omission” is precisely the imbalance between agitation
and propaganda—or however else one wishes to term it. p. 476

>Classes produce
parties, and parties form the personnel of State and government, the
leaders of civil and political society. There must be a useful and fruitful
relation in these manifestations and functions. There cannot be any
formation of leaders without the theoretical, doctrinal activity of parties,
without a systematic attempt to discover and study the causes which
govern the nature of the class represented and the way in which it has
developed. Hence, scarcity of State and government personnel; squalor
of parliamentary life; ease with which the parties can be disintegrated,
by corruption and absorption of the few individuals who are
indispensable. Hence, squalor of cultural life and wretched inadequacy
of high culture. Instead of political history, bloodless erudition; instead of
religion, superstition; instead of books and great reviews, daily papers
and broadsheets; instead of serious politics, ephemeral quarrels and
personal clashes. p.477

### The Philosophy of the Epoch

Why did the hegemony of the ruling group fall apart in the previous epoch?

>1. because great masses, previously passive, entered into
movement—but into a chaotic and disorganised movement, without
leadership, i.e. without any precise collective political will; 2. because
the middle classes, who during the war held positions of command and
responsibility, when peace came were deprived of these and left
unemployed—precisely after having learned how to command, etc.; 3.
because the antagonistic forces proved to be incapable of organising this
situation of disorder to their own advantage. The problem was to
reconstruct a hegemonic apparatus for these formerly passive and
apolitical elements. It was impossible to achieve this without the use of
force—which could not be “legal” force, etc. 479

### Political Struggle and MIlitary War

When you win at military war, you get peace. Politics is more complicated.

>Another point to be kept in mind is that in political struggle one
should not ape the methods of the ruling classes, or one will fall into
easy ambushes. In the current struggles this phenomenon often occurs.
A weakened State structure is like a flagging army; the commandos—i.e.
the private armed organisations—enter the field, and they have two
tasks: to make use of illegal means, while the State appears to remain
within legality, and thus to reorganise the State itself. It is stupid to
believe that when one is confronted by illegal private action one can
counterpose to it another similar action—in other words, combat
commando tactics by means of commando tactics. It means believing
that the State remains perpetually inert, which is never the case—quite
apart from all the other conditions which differ. The class factor leads to
a fundamental difference: a class which has to work fixed hours every
day cannot have permanent and specialised assault organisations—as
can a class which has ample financial resources and all of whose
members are not tied down by fixed work. p.485d


>The same reduction must take place in the art and science of politics,
at least in the case of the most advanced States, where “civil society”
has become a very complex structure and one which is resistant to the
catastrophic “incursions” of the immediate economic element (crises,
depressions, etc.). The superstructures of civil society are like the trenchsystems
of modern warfare. In war it would sometimes happen that a
fierce artillery attack seemed to have destroyed the enemy’s entire
defensive system, whereas in fact it had only destroyed the outer
perimeter; and at the moment of their advance and attack the assailants
would find themselves confronted by a line of defence which was still
effective. The same thing happens in politics, during the great economic
crises. A crisis cannot give the attacking forces the ability to organise
with lightning speed in time and in space; still less can it endow them
with fighting spirit. Similarly, the defenders are not demoralised, nor do
they abandon their positions, even among the ruins, nor do they lose
faith in their own strength or their own future. p.489


### The Transition from the War of Manoeuvre to the War of Position
A war of maneuver where you're actually doing things, often leads to defeat. A war of position is different.

>The war of position demands enormous
sacrifices by infinite masses of people. So an unprecedented
concentration of hegemony is necessary, and hence a more
“interventionist” government, which will take the offensive more openly
against the oppositionists and organise permanently the “impossibility”
of internal disintegration—with controls of every kind, political,
administrative, etc., reinforcement of the hegemonic “positions” of the
dominant group, etc. All this indicates that we have entered a
culminating phase in the political-historical situation, since in politics
the “war of position”, once won, is decisive definitively p.495

In a war of maneuver, there is not a decisive winner. In a war of position, one spends a long time, a seige, fighting a tiring battle.

### Internationalism and National Policy

>the internal relations of any nation are the result of a
combination which is “original” and (in a certain sense) unique: these
relations must be understood and conceived in their originality and
uniqueness if one wishes to dominate them and direct them. To be sure,
the line of development is towards internationalism, but the point of
departure is “national”—and it is from this point of departure that one
must begin. Yet the perspective is international and cannot be otherwise.
Consequently, it is necessary to study accurately the combination of
national forces which the international class [the proletariat] will have to
lead and develop, p.499

This is about trotsky vs stalin and how to understand the national politics of an international movement. In order to do so, one must cut through all the bs of international politics to make sense of the nations current situation with respect to the international one.

>That non-national concepts (i.e. ones that cannot be referred to
each individual country) are erroneous can be seen ab absurdo: they
have led to passivity and inertia in two quite distinct phases: I. in the
first phase, nobody believed that they ought to make a start—that is to
say, they believed that by making a start they would find themselves
isolated; they waited for everybody to move together, and nobody in the
meantime moved or organised the movement; 2. the second phase is
perhaps worse, because what is being awaited is an anachronistic and
anti-natural form of “Napoleonism” (since not all historical phases repeat
themselves in the same form)

### Problem of the Collective Man or of Social Conformism
The state is about creating new and higher types of civilisation, but how do you get people to consent to this?

>But how will each single individual succeed in incorporating
himself into the collective man, and how will educative pressure be
applied to single individuals so as to obtain their consent and their
collaboration, turning necessity and coercion into “freedom”? p.502

>the “Permanent Revolution” is expanded and
transcended in political science by the formula of “civil hegemony”. The
same thing happens in the art of politics as happens in military art: war
of movement increasingly becomes war of position, and it can be said
that a State will win a war in so far as it prepares for it minutely and
technically in peacetime. p.503

### Sociology and Political Science

>Everything that is of real importance in sociology is nothing other than
political science. “Politics” became synonymous with parliamentary
politics or the politics of personal cliques. Conviction that the
constitutions and parliaments had initiated an epoch of “natural”
“evolution”, that society had discovered its definitive, because rational,
foundations, etc. And, lo and behold, society can now be studied with
the methods of the natural sciences! Impoverishment of the concept of
the State which ensued from such views. If political science means
science of the State, and the State is the entire complex of practical and
theoretical activities with which the ruling class not only justifies and
maintains its dominance, but manages to win the active consent of
those over whom it rules, then it is obvious that all the essential
questions of sociology are nothing other than the questions of political
science. If there is a residue, this can only be made up of false
problems, i.e. frivolous problems p.504

I wonder what the frivolous problems are!

### Hegemony and Separation of Powers

The separation of powers is the result of a crisis that is solved  politically.

>Essential importance of the separation of powers for political and
economic liberalism; the entire liberal ideology, with its strengths and its
weaknesses, can be encapsulated in the principle of the separation of
powers, and the source of liberalism’s weakness then becomes
apparent: it is the bureaucracy—i.e. the crystallisation of the leading
personnel—which exercises coercive power, and at a certain point it
becomes a caste. Hence the popular demand for making all posts
elective—a demand which is extreme liberalism, p.507

This section isn't really finished

#### The Conception of Law

>The conception of law will have to be freed from every residue of
transcendentalism and from every absolute; in practice, from every
moralistic fanaticism. However, it seems to me that one cannot start
from the point of view that the State does not “punish” (if this term is
reduced to its human significance), but only struggles against social
“dangerousness”. In reality, the State must be conceived of as an
“educator”, in as much as it tends precisely to create a new type or level
of civilisation. p.508

### The State
There is a confusion between state and regulated society.

>In my opinion, the most reasonable and concrete thing that can be
said about the ethical State,60 the cultural State, is this: every State is
ethical in as much as one of its most important functions is to raise the
great mass of the population to a particular cultural and moral level, a
level (or type) which corresponds to the needs of the productive forces
for development, and hence to the interests of the ruling classes. The
school as a positive educative function, and the courts as a repressive
and negative educative function, are the most important State activities
in this sense: but, in reality, a multitude of other so-called private
initiatives and activities tend to the same end—initiatives and activities
which form the apparatus of the political and cultural hegemony of the
ruling classes. p.526

>The State does have and request consent, but
it also “educates” this consent, by means of the political and syndical
associations; these, however, are private organisms, left to the private
initiative of the ruling class p.527

>The expressions “ethical State” or “civil society” would thus mean
that this “image” of a State without a State was present to the greatest
political and legal thinkers, in so far as they placed themselves on the
terrain of pure science p.533

I don't know how much i'm following here...


>totalitarian65 policy is aimed precisely: 1.
at ensuring that the members of a particular party find in that party all
the satisfactions that they formerly found in a multiplicity of
organisations, i.e. at breaking all the threads that bind these members to
extraneous cultural organisms; 2. at destroying all other organisations or
at incorporating them into a system of which the party is the sole
regulator.



>n Mein Kampf Hitler writes: “The founding or the destruction of a
religion is an action of immeasurably greater importance than the
founding or the destruction of a State: not to speak of a party. . .”
Superficial and acritical. The three elements—religion (or “active”
conception of the world), State, party—are indissoluble, and in the real
process of historico-political development there is a necessary passage
from one to the other. p.540

>concept of “subversive”74 can be explained as
follows: a negative rather than a positive class position—the
“people” is aware that it has enemies, but only identifies them
empirically as the so-called signori.75 p.551

On Materialism
>The problem is the following: can a rift between popular masses and
ruling ideologies as serious as that which emerged after the war be
“cured” by the simple exercise of force, preventing the new ideologies
from imposing themselves? Will the interregnum, the crisis whose
historically normal solution is blocked in this way, necessarily be
resolved in favour of a restoration of the old? Given the character of the
ideologies, that can be ruled out—yet not in an absolute sense. p.556
