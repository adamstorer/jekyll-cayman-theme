## Lecture One

Foucault is bummed because all of his stuff seems disparate and inconclusive - this is discipline and punish and history of sexuality.

We have seen the fall of totalizing theories as everything is up for a kind of reimagination.
>But I believe these tools have only been provided on
the condition that the theoretical unity of these discourses
was in some sense put in abeyance , or at least curtailed,
divided, overthrown, caricatured, theatricalised, or what
you will. In each case , the attempt to think in terms of a
totality has in fact proved a hindrance to research . p. 81

So, one of the main changes is the LOCAL CHARACTER OF CRITICISM.

The local criticism is characterized by a focus more on the reality of a situation than the theory of it.

That is, there have been some kind of subjugated knowledges: historical contents that have been buried, and when resurfaced produced more complex theories. But also, a focus on naive knowledges, beneath cognition or science. Through the re-emergence of low-ranking knowledge (a local, regional knowledge) begins to disqualify some of the totalizing theory.

So, we become interested in a historical knowledge of struggles - in which we get a genealogy - the combined product of an erudite and popular knowledge, which is impossible without some kind of over-arching theory.

*But why are the two incompatible?*
>Let us give the term genealogy to the union of erudite
knowledge and local memories which allows us to establish
a historical k nowledge of struggles and to make use of this
k nowledge tactically today. This then will be a provisional
definition of the genealogies which I have attempted to
compile with you over the last few years. p. 83

The question is, what power does a totalizing theory give you?

>W hat types of knowledge do you want to disqualify in the
very instant of your demand : 'Is it a science '? Which
speaking, d iscoursing subjects- which subjects of experience
and knowledge- do you then want to 'diminish '
when you say: ' I who conduct this discourse am conducting a
scientific discourse, and I am a scientist'? Which theoreticalpolitical
a vant garde do you want to enthrone in order to
isolate it from all the discontinuous forms of knowledge that
circulate about it? p. 85


>a genealogy should
be seen as a kind of attempt to emancipate historical
knowledges from that subjection , to render them, that is,
capable of opposition and of struggle against the coercion of
a theoretical , unitary, formal and scientific discourse . It is
based on a reactivation of local knowledges- of minor
knowledges, as Deleuze might call them- in opposition to
the scientific hierarchisation of knowledges and the effects
intrinsic to their power: this, then , is the project of these
disordered and fragmentary genealogies. p.85

Why not reintigrate the knowledge into something larger?
>And if we want to protect these only
lately liberated fragments are we not in danger of ourselves
constructing, with our own hands, that unitary discourse to
w hich we are invited, perhaps to lure us into a trap , by those
who say to u s : 'All this is fine, but where are you heading?
W hat kind of unity are you after? ' The temptation, up to a
certain point, is to reply : 'Well, we just go on , in a
cumulative fashion ; after all, the moment at which we risk
colonisation has not yet arrived' .p.86

What point might Foucault be making? He doesn't want to make a point, but maybe there is something with respect to many conceptions of power from Marxist to liberal. In all of them there is something like an economic functionality of power.
<def>Economic functionality of power: When power is conceived primarily in terms of the role it plays in the maintenance simultaneously of the relations of production and of a class domination which the development and specific forms of the forces of production have rendered possible.</def>

Here power is found in the economy, and all other power is subordinate. But power is really about repression, is it not? So shouldn't it be about the mechanisms of repression? Or that we should think about it in terms of war?
>So, no sooner do we attempt to l iberate ourselves from
economistic analyses of power, than two solid hypotheses
offer themselves: the one argues that the mechanisms of
power are those of repression. For convenience sake , I shall
term this Reich 's hypothesis . The other argues that the basis
of the relationship of power lies in the hostile engagement of
forces. Again for convenience , I shall call this N ietzsche 's
hypothesis p.91

>I have always been especially diffident of this notion of
repressio n : it is precisely with reference to those genealogies
of which I was speaking j ust now - of the history of penal
righ t , of psychiatric power, of the control of infantile
sexuality e tc . - that I have tried to demonstrate to you the
extent to which the mechanisms that were brought into
operation in these power formations were something quite
other, or in any case something much more , than repression.
The need to i nvestigate this notion of repression more
thoroughly springs therefore from the impression I have
that it is wholly inadequate to the analysis of the mechanisms
and effects of power that it is so pervasively used to
characterise today p.92

## Lecture Two

Foucault studies the how of power - with respect to two reference points:
1. The rules of right that provie a formal delimitation of power
2. The effects of truth that this power produces and transmits - which reproduce power. There is a triangle - power, right, truth.

Here, I think, is the brunt of Foucault's search:
>. My problem is
rather this : what rules of right are implemented by the
relations of power in the production of discourses of truth?
O r alternatively, what type of power is susceptible of
producing discourses of truth that in a society such as ours are
endowed with such potent effects? What I mean is this : in a
society such as ours, but basically in any society, there are
m a nifold relations of power which permeate , characterise
and constitute the social body , and these relations of power
cannot themselves be established, consolidated nor imp
lemented without the production , accumulation , circulation
and functioning of a discourse . There can be no possible
exercise of power without a certain economy of discourses
of truth which operates through and on the basis of this
association. p. 105

Power is the ability to produce truth! And so let's think about royal power -
>When we say that sovereignty is the central problem of
right in Western societies, what we mean basically is that the
essential function of the discourse and techniques of right
has been to efface the domination intrinsic to power in
o rder to present the latter at the level of appearance under
two different aspects : on the one hand, as the legitimate
rights of sovereignty, and on the other, as the legal
o bligation to obey it. p. 96


>To give an
example : rather than try to discover where and how the
right of punishment is founded on sovereignty , how it is
p rese nted in the theory of monarchical right or in that of
democratic right, I have tried to see in what ways punishment
and the power of punishment are effectively embodied
in a certain number of local , regional, material institutions,
w h ich are concerned with torture or imprisonment, and to
p lace these in the climate - at once institutional and
physical , regulated and violent- of the effective apparatuses
of punishment. In other words, one should try to locate
power at the extreme points of its exercise , where it is
alwa ys less legal in character . p.96-7

So, the focus of power should be more on its enactment than on its formal top points. Additionally, it should not be at the form of conscious intention or decision, but instead in how it is invested in effective practices.
>What is needed is a study of power in its
external visage , at the point where it is in direct and
immediate relationship with that which we can provisionally
call its obj ect, its target, its field of application, there- that
is to say-where it installs itself and produces its real effects. p. 97

Also - power is not an individual phenomenon. It is not the difference between who has it and who doesn't.
>Power m ust by analysed as something which circulates, or
rather as something which only functions in the form of a
chain . I t is never localised here or there , never in anybody's
hands, never appropriated as a commodity or piece of
wealth . Power is employed and exercised through a net-like
o rganisation . And not only do individuals circulate between
its threads ; they are always in the position of simultaneously
undergoing and exercising this power. p. 98

The individual is an effect of power as well as its articulation.

One more (I hope thing)
>when I say that power establishes a network
through which it freely circulates, this is true only up to a
certain point...the important
thing is not to attempt some kind of deduction of power
starting from its centre and aimed at the discovery of the
extent to which it permeates into the base , of the degree to
which it reproduces itself down to and including the most
molecular elements of society. One must rather conduct an
ascending a nalysis of power, starting, that is, from its
infinitesimal mechanisms, which each have their own
h istory , their own trajectory, their own techniques and
tactics , and then see how these mechanisms of power have
been - and continue to be - invested , colonised , utilised ,
involuted , transformed, displaced , extended etc. , by ever
more general mechanisms and by forms of global domin
ation p. 99

That is, start at the bottom and move up.  THis is a really valid critique of Bourdieu, who always moves from the top down.

The fifth methodological precaution  - major mechanisms of power are possibly accompanied by ideological productions. However, what happens is not ideological.
>It is the production of
e ffective instruments for the formation and accumulation of
knowledge - methods of observation, techniques of registratio
n , procedures for investigation and research , apparatuses
of control. All this means that power, when it is exe
rcised through these subtle mechanisms, cannot but evolve ,
o rganise and put into circulation a knowledge , or rather apparatuses
of knowledge , which are not ideological constructs. p. 102

Foucault's overall point:
>B y way of summarising these five methodological precautions,
I would say that we should direct our researches
o n the n ature of power not towards the j uridical edifice of
sovereignty, the State apparatuses and the ideologies which
accompany them, but towards domination and the material
operators of power, towards forms of subjection and the
inflections and utilisations of their localised systems, and
towards strategic apparatuses. We must eschew the model of
Leviathan in the study of power. We must escape from the
limited field of j uridical sovereignty and State institutions,
and instead base our analysis of power on the study of the
techniques and tactics of domination. p102

When thinking about power - we see in the 17th and 18th century that a new mechanism of power develops which is at odds with sovereinty - is focused on rule making and focused on the body.
>It is a type of power which is
constantly exercised by means of surveillance rather than in
a discontinuous manner by means of a system of levies or
obligations distributed over time. It presupposes a tightly
knit grid of material coercions rather than the physical
existence of a sovereign. It is ultimately dependent upon the
principle, which introduces a genuinely new economy of
power, that one must be able simultaneously both to
increase the subjected forces and to improve the force and
efficacy of that which subj ects them . p. 104

>believe that the
process which has really rendered the discourse of the
human sciences possible is the j uxtaposition, the encounter
between two lines of approach, two mechanisms, two
absolutely heterogeneous types of discourse : on the one
hand there is the re-organisation of right that invests
sovereignty, and on the other, the mechanics of the coercive
forces whose exercise takes a disciplinary form. And I
believe that in our own times power is exercised simultaneously
through this right and these techn iques and that
these tech niques and these discourses, to which the disciplines
give rise invade the area of right so that the procedures
of normalisation come to be ever more constantly
engaged in the colonisation of those of law . I believe that all
this can explain the global functioning of what I would call a
society of normalisation . p. 107
