Abstract: "This paper takes stock of the most recent scholarship on symbolic boundaries and how these interact with social boundaries—more durable and institutionalized social differences. Our primary goal is to raise awareness of a growing body of empirical work, and to highlight key mechanisms which they address, among them: the strategic management of collective identities, cultural classification, the construction of authenticity, moral boundary maintenance, and genre-crossing. We introduce the articles included in this issue and discuss how ethno-racial boundaries intersect with class, immigration, and nationhood. We also describe new work on aesthetic boundaries, as well as recent efforts pertaining to gender, sexuality, the workplace, and religion. We close with a discussion of promising research on health, risk, and policy. We hope to demonstrate some of the intellectual rewards of interdisciplinary engagement, and encourage others to more systematically contribute to analyzing fundamental boundary processes."

## Introduction

We stick with the notions of symbolic and social boundaries.

This is focused on boundary mechanisms. Ethno-racial and easthetic boundaries, moral boundaries, and claims to boundary authenticity.

## Recent Scholarship on Boundaries

People are often quite interested still on how boundaries create inequality, for instnace.

ONe hopes to make sense of the cognititive, cultural and social processes of boundary making and understand the mechanisms that activate boundary processes. What are the general processes that lead to ethnic boundary formation? Social closure, cultural differentiation, and political stability.

Different classes also think of socialization and child rearing in different ways. Think of concerted cultivation

When thinking about how groups distinguish themselves from other groups, new barriers tendto make sense.

>The work of Binder (2002) on how
Afrocentrists and Creationists engaged with local school systems to influence their curricula
stands out. She examines how the two groups defined themselves as groups who were being
discriminated against. The cultural resources and organizational opportunity structures available
to the two groups differed, which influenced how they framed their grievances in light of patterns
of historical discrimination and comparative advantage, and the outcomes of their challenges in
terms of school curricula p. 336

People also work to understand multiple and different boundaries.

### Aesthetic Boundaries

These boundaries are often considered important .


## Emerging Directions

Medical professsionals perform boundary maintenance, fo rinstance by making sense of how traditional and spiritual medicinal acts means people must do some kind of science/non-science type work.

Risk and boundaries also play a role in trying to symbolize meaningin social policy. Also, how boundaries of responsibility are drawn can lead to interesting public policy outcomes, such as a failure to deal with the levies correctly in New Orleans.

## Discussion

What are some interesting aspects to consider:
1. The multidimensionality in collective identity formation
2. Conceptualizing multiple, interacting boundaries
3.  How diverse social networks influence boundary processes and vice versa
4. How different types of cultural capital contribute to the production of boundaries
5. How organizational and institutional structures influence boundary processes.
