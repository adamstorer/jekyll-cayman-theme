Abstract:
defs_used:

    Ideology: Idea systems deployed as self-conscious political arguments by identifiable political actors. 
    Cultural Idioms: Longer term, anonymous, and less partisan existence than ideologies. Idioms structure argument in partially unintended ways, and may also deelop new ideological arguments.

Sewell critiqued States and Social Revolutions - something I didn't read, makign this probably a pretty bad choice of tiings to read.

>He rightly points out that I treated the issues too cursorily and relied upon a notion of ideologies as deliberate blueprints for change that leaves untouched many of the ways in which ideas may affect the course of revolutions. Sewell offers instead "a much more robust conception of ideology . . . that treats ideology as anonymous, collective, and constitutive of social order."2 According to Sewell, this way of understanding ideology is consonant with the overall structural analysis of States and Social Revolutions, and it can guide us toward wise questions and answers about the role of ideological transformations in the French Revolution and beyond. p. 2

Skocpol wanted to argue that no single acting group deliberately shapes the complex conflicts that bring about revolutionary crises and outcomes.

>If the purpose is to explain in cross-nationally relevant terms why revolutions break out in some times and places and not others, and why they accomplish some changes and not others, we cannot achieve this by theorizing as if some grand intentionality governs revolutionary processe p.87


>Class structures and conflicts, I argued, are not the only or the basic "structural" keys to revolutionary causes or outcomes. Analysts need to focus more directly on the international re- lationships of states to one another, and on the relationships of old-regime rulers and revolutionary state builders to dominant and subordinate classes. Class conflicts as such, especially conflicts pitting peasants against landlords and existing agrarian property relations, certainly entered into the processes of revolution in France, Russia, and China. But one must constantly focus on the direct and indirect interactions of class struggles with the primary conflicts in these revolutions-the conflicts surrounding the breakdown of the administrative and coercive organizations of the old-regime monarchical states, and the subsequent, often highly protracted conflicts over the kinds of new state organizations that would be successfully consolidated in the place of the prerevolutionary regimes. Thus, in France, peasant revolts in 1789 both grew out of and accelerated the collapse of monarchical absolutis p.87

## REvolutions as Ideological Reamkings of the World

WE must see social revolutions as ideologically inspired projects rather than class conflicts. Sewell sees the ideological remaking of the world that is social revolution as impersonal, anonymous and collective, whereas Walzer sees it as intentional.

>According to Sewell, what came to the fore in August 1789 was a new ideological idiom, a new set of principles of discourse and action, under the aegis of which many contending groups then proceeded to wage political struggles. In contrast to Walzer, Sewell's approach has the important advantage that we can talk about contending and successive "ideo- logical variants" developed by different groups of actors. p.89

## Disadvantages of an Anthropolical Understanding of Cultural Systems

Sewell has drawbacks. Sewell sees a certain moment as THE moment. It is totalistic and synchronous in an unrealistic way.

>This reflects what I will label Sewell's "cultural system" under- standing of ideology. As he puts it, ideology is "constitutive of social order," and "if society is understood as ideologically constituted," then "it is not enough to treat ideology as a possible causal factor explaining some portion of the change wrought by revolution." Instead, "the replacement of one socio-ideological order by another. . . becomes a crucial dimension of the change that needs to be explained" for any given revolution. p. 89

This is too systematic.

So what do we do? WE separate things out
<def>Ideology: Idea systems deployed as self-conscious political arguments by identifiable political actors. </def>
<def>Cultural Idioms: Longer term, anonymous, and less partisan existence than ideologies. Idioms structure argument in partially unintended ways, and may also deelop new ideological arguments.</def>

>Substantively speaking, the analysis of cultural idioms and ideologies in social revolutions deserves treatment analogous to the analysis of class relations and class conflicts: both phenomena must be studied in relation to the central drama of the breakdown and rebuilding of state organizations. Sewell asserts that a huge range of reforms introduced by French revolutionaries "are in- comprehensible except as a result of [Enlightenment] revolutionary ideology." I do not agree (and I am not even exactly sure what this statement means). Although many reforms were indeed conceptualized in the light of certain understandings of Enlightenment ideals, the reforms figured in ongoing political struggles and typically helped (as much as possible in given circumstances) to strengthen the authority of the French national state in relation to the Church and particular private groups ranging from the wealthy and privileged to local communities p. 92

Political ideology must be thought of in a different way. The new regime Enlightenment principles were one of many that became part of a political ideology. The old system was not overarching within an ideological system.

>From this perspective, Enlightenment dis- courses-plural-emerge as important idioms, but not the only idioms, used in the political ideologies developed by revolutionary state builders in France from 1789 until the collapse of the Terror. Recognizing this, we can do a more historically grounded job of explaining the culturally conditioned choices of these conscious actors-and a better job of explaining the successes and failures of their ideas and arguments within the overall context of multiple cultural idioms and contending ideologies that constituted the ideational aspect of the French Revolution. p.94
