Abstract: "It is assumed that leaders can boost the motivation of employees by communicating the organization’s ultimate aspirations, yet evidence on the effectiveness of this tactic is equivocal. On some occasions, it causes employees to view their work as more meaningful. At other times, it causes them to become dispirited. These inconsistent findings may in part be explained by a paradox - the very features that make ultimate aspirations meaningful—their breadth and timelessness—undermine the ability of employees to see how their daily responsibilities are associated with them. To understand how leaders can help employees resolve this paradox, I analyzed archival evidence to explore the actions of President John F. Kennedy when leading NASA in the 1960s. I found that Kennedy enacted four sensegiving steps, each of which helped employees see a stronger connection between their work and NASA’s ultimate aspirations. When this connection was strongest, employees construed their day-today work not as short-term tasks (‘‘I’m building electrical circuits’’) but as the pursuit of NASA’s long-term objective (‘‘I’m putting a man on the moon’’) and the aspiration this objective symbolized (‘‘I’m advancing science’’). My findings redirect research by conceptualizing leaders as architects who motivate employees most effectively when they provide a structural blueprint that maps the connections between employees’ everyday work and the organization’s ultimate aspirations."

Abstract
>It is assumed that leaders can boost the motivation of employees by communicating
the organization’s ultimate aspirations, yet evidence on the effectiveness
of this tactic is equivocal. On some occasions, it causes employees to view
their work as more meaningful. At other times, it causes them to become dispirited.
These inconsistent findings may in part be explained by a paradox - the
very features that make ultimate aspirations meaningful—their breadth and
timelessness—undermine the ability of employees to see how their daily
responsibilities are associated with them. To understand how leaders can help
employees resolve this paradox, I analyzed archival evidence to explore the
actions of President John F. Kennedy when leading NASA in the 1960s. I found
that Kennedy enacted four sensegiving steps, each of which helped employees
see a stronger connection between their work and NASA’s ultimate aspirations.
When this connection was strongest, employees construed their day-today
work not as short-term tasks (‘‘I’m building electrical circuits’’) but as the
pursuit of NASA’s long-term objective (‘‘I’m putting a man on the moon’’) and
the aspiration this objective symbolized (‘‘I’m advancing science’’). My findings
redirect research by conceptualizing leaders as architects who motivate
employees most effectively when they provide a structural blueprint that maps
the connections between employees’ everyday work and the organization’s
ultimate aspirations.

Basically, the notion is that meaningfulness of work is important for people, more important than many other things in predicting outcomes. Some try to boost meaningfulness by articulating the organizations aspirations. While some studies say this is effective, other studies see the opposite. It may be because day to day work is so separate from aspirations.

>A logical extension of these arguments is that the messages leaders use to
convey the organization’s ultimate aspirations present a paradox: the very properties
that make ultimate aspirations meaningful are those that leave employees
unable to sense how their daily responsibilities are associated with them. p.3

The paper is about overcoming the paradox by looking at how JFK talks about NASA.

Organizational Goals have ultimate aspirations and short-term targets. People do not focus enough on the short term target. There is something they thinka bout as construal fit, in which people construe the top level goals as important for all. We know individuals like to somehow be involved in short-term plans, but how do they do something in the middle? This is where the inductive analysis comes in. He looked for four themese - day to day work, organizational objectives, connectionsand meanigfulness. I'm not sure if you can really tell on the ground how people felt about something if you werne't there. He did an open coding type thing.

There are two stages - sensegiving actions and connection-building.


## Sensegiving Actions
1. Reduce number of NASA's ultimate aspirations to one - advance science by exploring the solar system.
2. Shift attention from ultimate aspirations to concrete objectives - Land on the moon before 1970, Explore Solary system.
3. Limited Milestones - Create a plausible pathway to success
4. Use embodied concepts to link ultimate aspirations to objectives

## Connection Building - How to connect day to day work with NASA's aspirations.

1. Employee perceives that objective is closer than ultimate aspiration
2. Employee perceives stepping stones that org will use to attain objective
3. Employee perceives he/she is personally contributing to objective's attainment.
4. Employee reconstructs day-to-day work as the organizational objective
5. Employee reconstructs day-to-day work as ultimate aspiration.

>My findings indicate that scholars can conceptualize leaders as architects who
optimally motivate employees when they create a cognitive blueprint composed
of a small and streamlined constellation of connections that link everyday
work and the organization’s ultimate aspirations and then allow employees
to mentally assemble more elaborate connections around that core structure
(Hanges, Lord, and Dickson, 2000). This positions employees to perceive that
they themselves are enacting the organization’s objective (‘‘I’m putting a man
on the moon’’) and ultimate aspiration (‘‘I’m advancing science’’) in their everyday
work. p.30

It's definitely a strategy, but there's no evidence that it's effective.
