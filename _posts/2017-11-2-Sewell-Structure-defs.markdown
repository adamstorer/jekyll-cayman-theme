Abstract: "Structure is one of the most important, elusive, and undertheorized concepts in the social sciences. Setting out from a critique and reformulation of Anthony Giddens's notion of the duality of structure and Pierre Bourdieu's notion of habitus, this article attempts to develop a theory of structure that restores human agency to social actors, builds the possibility of change into the concept of structure, and overcomes the divide between semiotic and materialist visions of structure."
defs_used:

    What does Giddens say about structure?: Structures are both the medium and the outcome of the practices which constitute social systems
    Giddens formal Definition of Structure: Rules and resources, recursively implicated in the reproduction of social systems. Structure exists only as memory traces, the organic basis of human knowledgeability, and as instantiated in action.
    What are schemas for Giddens/Sewell: Generalizble pocedures applied in the enactment/reproduction of social life. They can be applied in various contexts. They can be transposed from one situation to the other
    How does Giddens define resources as a component of structure?: the media whereby transformative capacity is employed as power in the routine course of social interaction.
    How does Sewell reformulate resources in the definition of structures as schemas and resources?: Re­sources are of two types, human and nonhuman. Nonhuman resources are objects, animate or inanimate, naturally occurring or manufactured, that can be used to enhance or maintain power. human resources are physical strength, dexterity, knowledge, and emotional commitments that can be used to enhance or maintain power, including knowledge of the means of gaining, retaining, controlling, and propagating either hu­man or nonhuman resources. Both types of resources are media of power and are unevenly distributed. But however unequally resources may be distributed, some measure of both human and nonhuman resources are controlled by all members of society, no matter how destitute and op­pressed.
    Sewell's definition of habitus: the mental reproduction of schemas and resources that creates temporarily durable structures, and this is the defintion of habitus.
    What are the two aspects of how structures differ from one another?: Depth (how deeply held is a schema, how does the schema effect other schema) and power (resources)

Abstract
>Structure is one of the most important, elusive, and undertheorized concepts in the social sciences. Setting out from a critique and reformulation of Anthony Giddens's notion of the duality of structure and Pierre Bourdieu's notion of habitus, this article attempts to develop a theory of structure that restores human agency to social actors, builds the possibility of change into the concept of structure, and overcomes the divide between semiotic and materialist visions of structure.

Sewell wants to understand what culture means. There is something about structure not quite capture by pattern:
>Whatever aspect of social life we designate as structure is posited as "structuring" some other aspect of social existence-whether it is class that structures politics, gender that structures employment opportunities, rhetorical conventions that structure texts or utterances, or modes of production that structure social formations.

Sewell has three problems with the use of structure:
1. Structuralist arguments have too much causal determinism. You lose the agency when talking about structure.
2. Structure does not deal well with change.
3. Sometimes structure is used in contradictory ways, as opposed to culture or as being perhaps the primary place of culture.

But structure does something too powerful to give up on:
>the notion of structure does denominate, however problematically, some­thing very important about social relations: the tendency of patterns of relations to be reproduced, even when actors engaging in the relations are unaware of the patterns or do not desire their reproduction.  p.3

So what will a theory of structure have - agency, change, and clarity.

## Reformulating Giddens Theory
<def>What does Giddens say about structure?: Structures are both the medium and the outcome of the practices which constitute social systems</def>

However Giddens theory is under specified. What is structure!!

Giidens has another formal definition
<def>Giddens formal Definition of Structure: Rules and resources, recursively implicated in the reproduction of social systems. Structure exists only as memory traces, the organic basis of human knowledgeability, and as instantiated in action.</def>

>Giddens likens his own distinction between structure and practice to the Saussurian distinction between langue and parole. According to this analogy, structure is to practice as langue (the abstract rules that make possible the production of grammatical sentences) is to parole (speech, or the production of actual sentences; 1976, pp. 118-22). Hence structure, like langue, is a complex of rules with a "virtual" existence, while prac­tice, like speech, is an enactment of these rules in space and time. p.6

There is somethign about the virtual that Sewell doesn't seem to really agree with. Giddens believes that there also needs to be resources in addition to the strange virtual rules.

Essentially people carry around structure in their heads.

But there is somethign good about structure as rules or, more correctly, informal unconscous rules or assumptions. This would be conventions, recipes, scenarios, principles of action etc.

>Because of this ambiguity about the meaning of the word "rules," I believe it is useful to introduce a change in terminology. Henceforth I shall use the term "schemas" rather than "rules"-even though this destroys the pleasing alliteration of Giddens's "rules and resources" formula.  pl.9

<def>What are schemas for Giddens/Sewell: Generalizble pocedures applied in the enactment/reproduction of social life. They can be applied in various contexts. They can be transposed from one situation to the other</def>

Sewell gives some examples of schemas:
>Such schemas or procedures-whether rules of etiquette, or aesthetic norms, or such reci­pes for group action as the royal progress, grain riot, or democratic vote, or a set of equivalences between wet and dry, female and male, nature and culture, private and public, or the body as a metaphor for hierarchy, or the notion that the human being is composed of a body and a soul­can be used not only in the situation in which they are first learned or most conventionally applied. They can be generalized-that is, trans­posed or extended-to new situations when the opportunity arises.

The virtuality then is something real, that is made more real because of its transposability.

## Structures as Resources

<def>How does Giddens define resources as a component of structure?: the media whereby transformative capacity is employed as power in the routine course of social interaction.</def>
<def>How does Sewell reformulate resources in the definition of structures as schemas and resources?: Re­sources are of two types, human and nonhuman. Nonhuman resources are objects, animate or inanimate, naturally occurring or manufactured, that can be used to enhance or maintain power. human resources are physical strength, dexterity, knowledge, and emotional commitments that can be used to enhance or maintain power, including knowledge of the means of gaining, retaining, controlling, and propagating either hu­man or nonhuman resources. Both types of resources are media of power and are unevenly distributed. But however unequally resources may be distributed, some measure of both human and nonhuman resources are controlled by all members of society, no matter how destitute and op­pressed.</def>


What are some examples of resources?
>Nonhuman resources would surely include such things as factories owned by capitalists, stocks of weapons controlled by kings or generals, land rented by peasants, or stacks of Hudson Bay blankets accumulated by Kwakiutl chiefs. It is clear that factories, armaments, land, and Hudson Bay blankets have had a crucial weight in shaping and constraining social life in particular times and places, and it therefore seems sensible to include them in some way in a concept of structure p.10

Even children's sense of obligation to mothers can be a resource. I am not sure how we could diagram this out in a way.

But perhaps resources are really the effects of cultural schemas, since the activation of even material things as "resources" is based on some predication of some virtual schemas.

## The Duality of Schemas and Resources

So we should perhaps find some kind of dual character in structure. They are composed simultaneously of virtual schemas and actual resources.

>If structures are dual in this sense, then it must be true that schemas are the effects of resources, just as resources are the effects of schemas. This seems to me a reasonable claim, one whose plausibility can be demonstrated by a few examples. p.13

Sewell basically shows how schemas effect resources and resources effect schemas.

## What about transformation? Habitus?

Where is change in this model?

### Duality and Stasis

Bourdieu's habitus shows how the world of objects influences mental structure which creates a kind of stasis.

A great quote here by Bourdieu:
>The mental structures which construct the world of objects are constructed in the practice of a world of objects constructed according to the same structures. The mind born of the world of objects does not rise as a subjec­tivity confronting an objectivity: the objective universe is made up of objects which are the product of objectifying operations structured according to the very structures which the mind applies_ to it. The mind is a metaphor of the world of objects which is itself but an endless circle of mutually reflecting metaphors. [Bourdieu 1977, p. 91]

<def>Sewell's definition of habitus: the mental reproduction of schemas and resources that creates temporarily durable structures, and this is the defintion of habitus.</def>

But we don't see agency! Or transformation!
> In Bour­dieu's habitus, schemas and resources so powerfully reproduce one an­other that even the most cunning or improvisational actions undertaken by agents necessarily reproduce the structure. "As an acquired system of generative schemes objectively adjusted to the particular conditions in which it is constituted, the habitus engenders all the thoughts, all the perceptions, and all the actions consistent with those conditions and no others" (Bourdieu 1977, p. 95). Although Bourdieu avoids either a tradi­tional French structuralist ideal determinism or a traditional Marxist material determinism, he does so only by erecting a combined determin­ism that makes significant social transformations seem impossible. p.15

So how does change happen?

1. Multiplicity of Structures - there are distinct structures at different levels which can be combined in new ways.
2. Transposability of Schemas - This allows for change as people transpose one schema onto another context.
3. Unpredictability of Resource Accumulation - WE never know how actions will be recieved in new settings. I've got to say this one doesn't make much sense to me. But transposing/enacting a scheme produces unpredictable resources to which we react semi dynamically.
4. Polysemy of Resources - Resources can mean different things depending on the schema/structure.
5. Intersection of Structures -
>One reason arrays of resources can be interpreted in more than one way is that structures or structural com­plexes intersect and overlap. The structures of capitalist society include both a mode of production based on private property and profit and a mode of labor organization based on workplace solidarity. The factory figures as a crucial resource in both of these structures, and its meaning and consequences for both workers and managers is therefore open and contested. The intersection of structures, in fact, takes place in both the schema and the resource dimensions. Not only can a given array of resources be claimed by different actors embedded in different structural complexes (or differentially claimed by the same actor embedded in dif­ferent structural complexes), but schemas can be borrowed or appro­priated from one structural complex and applied to another. Not only do workers and factory owners struggle for control of the factory, but Marx appropriates political economy for the advancement of socialism.  p.19


## What about Agency?

So agency is constituent of structure.
>Agency arises from the actor's knowledge of schemas, which means the ability to apply them to new contexts. Or, to put the same thing the other way around, agency arises from the actor's control of resources, which means the capacity to reinterpret or mobilize an array of resources in terms of schemas other than those that constituted the array. Agency is implied by the existence of structures.  p.20

Of course agency is constructed by a person's social millieu, and are historically determined, but there is still some agency there.

Also, agency is collective as well as individual.

## Is there a typology of structures?

There is an immense range of structures to which this sort of thing can be applied.
>I will offer no detailed typology­ both because space is short and because I feel that typologies should arise out of concrete analyses of social change and reproduction. Instead, I shall simply indicate two important dimensions along which structures vary: depth, which refers to the schema dimension of structure, and power, which refers to the resource dimension. p.23

<def>What are the two aspects of how structures differ from one another?: Depth (how deeply held is a schema, how does the schema effect other schema) and power (resources)</def>
>To designate a structure as "deep" implies that it lies beneath and generates a certain range of "surface" structures, just as structures underlie and generate practices. In structuralist discourse, deep struc­tures are those schemas that can be shown to underlie ordinary or "sur­face" structures, in the sense that the surface structures are a set of transformations of the deep structure p.22

Language, for instance, is a very deep schema. But oddly there is very little power/resources in language. What about capitalism? Capitalism has some unstable surface structures that change the way capitalism looks, but the deeper structure of exchange and use value is there always.
