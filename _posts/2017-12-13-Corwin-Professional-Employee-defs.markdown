Abstract: "A study of the conflict between conceptions of role and discrepancies between the ideal perceptions of role and reality among 296 graduate and student nurses suggests that, at graduation, inherent conflicts between professional and bureaucratic principles of organization are most seriously encountered. Those who express strong allegiance to bureaucratic and professional roles, simultaneously, also sense the greatest discrepancies between ideal conceptions and perceived opportunity to fulfil them-which is interpreted as evidence of their incompatibility. But, because of greater independence of collegiate programs from hospital administration, bureaucratic principles are less relevant there, while professional principles are stressed more than in the diploma program. There is evidence that diploma and degree graduates organize the bureaucratic-professional roles differently and adjust to conflict of roles in systematically different ways."

>A study of the conflict between conceptions of role and discrepancies between the ideal perceptions of role and reality among 296 graduate and student nurses suggests that, at graduation, inherent conflicts between professional and bureaucratic principles of organization are most seriously encountered. Those who express strong allegiance to bureaucratic and professional roles, simultaneously, also sense the greatest discrepancies between ideal conceptions and perceived opportunity to fulfil them-which is interpreted as evidence of their incompatibility.

As you move up in your career you get new status, and new understandings of the role, which may transform perceptions and beliefs. When you graduate from a vocational training program and start a career, this is a point where you have a reflexive moment to reassess. The training program gives you some idealized sense of what the job is supposed to be like, what values you are supposed to hold. The real job is focused likely more on bureaucracy. So the question is, which orientation wins out?

With respect to nursing, think about the different orientations.
>It is apparent that there is not one but at least three dominant conceptions of nursing-an office, a pro- fession, and a calling.6 These provide al- ternative identities for the nurse who is at the same time a hospital employee (or a bureaucrat), a responsible, independent professional, and a public servant (when in a religious or humanitarian context). Each identity provides a different source of loyalty-to the local administration, to professional principles and associations that transcend the local place of employment, and to the patient p.606

We identify two types of overal ideal types for orientations:
Bureaucracy and Profession.

There are three ways in which tye differ: Standardization of tasks, authority,and the relationship to organizational means and goals.

These two compete with each other, for instance, if you want to do something for a client that is not desired for bureaucracy. There is also some values of a traditional nursing role. These are service values. For instance, the less contact with the patient, the more rewarded they are, which is a series of strange requirements.

When the student becomes the worker, there are a number of things to consider:
>conflicts of loyalty be- tween the nursing profession and the hos- pital easily emerge. The nurse is in part a daily record-keeper and follower and en- forcer of the hospital rules and red Itape which often seem irrelevant to her profes- sional function. It may be difficult for the new graduate to understand what is pro- fessional about filling out six legal forms for each patient admitted and completing pages of detailed charts and reports each day; but the hospital requires a degree of conformity and loyalty to its rules and procedures to assure continuity p.608

The idea is that people have a hard time balancing these different duties, and the transition makes some contradictions readily apparent. There are three questiosn to make sense of this:
1. Do bureaucratic and professional conceptions of role conflict?
2. Are there systematic differences in the organization of roles produced by diploma and degree programs (degree programs are separate from the hospital, idealized and academic, diploma programs are functional within the hospital)
3. Do discrepancies between ideal roles and perceptions of reality increase after graduation.

There was a questionnaire of 201 staff nurses, 23 head nurses, and 71 student nurses with degree or diploma training from seven hospitals.

People who believe in both the bureaurcratic and professional aspects of the role have a lot more awareness of the discrepancy.

Do degree programs have an effect? Degree nurses see themselves as needing to maintain professionalism over diploma nurses.

>In general, then, the professional con- ception retains more, the bureaucratic con- ception relatively less, prominence among degree than among diploma nurses. But, after graduation, degree nurses also fre- quently attempt to combine it with high bureaucratic conception, which probably increases the conflict. On the other hand, among diploma nurses the popularity of both low bureaucratic and low professional conceptions provides them with an escape. p.612

For degree nurses vs diploma nurses, we see the following difference:

>In short, the professional allegiance of diploma nurses declines after graduation, while their initial loyalty to the hospital is maintained; but the reverse is true for de- gree graduates who maintain professional conceptions while increasing their alle- giance to the bureaucracy after employ- ment. p.613

<sum>This is pretty interesting. There is a really strong value judgement here. Mainly, the idea I think is that by indoctrinating the workers with professional values that are somewhat high minded in the degree programs, those workers hold onto those ideas even in the midst of others who do not, and are more aware of the trouble associated with both of these things. </sum>
