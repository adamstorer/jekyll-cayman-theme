What is modern bureaucracy?

1. There are jurisdictional areas that have the following properties - regular activities assigned as official duties, authority to give commands for duties is delimited by rules, and only people who are qualified for something are employed.

Bureaucracy is a modern institution that you see both in politics and government.

2. There is office hierarchy. Some are higher than others and everyone knows their organizational place.
3. The office is built on written documents.
4. Office management presupposes thorough training in a field of specialization (accountant maybe?)
5. Official activity should demand the full working capacity of the individual.
6. Management is done by rules which are exhaustive.

## The official within and outside of bureaurcracy

1. Office holding is a "vocation" - it requires training, one must give their whole working capacity for a long period of time, and there are special examinations. The official feels they have some duty to the office.

2. Social Position of the Official

There is some esteem and status tied to being a high level bureaucrat, particularly with respect to those who they govern. There is more esteem if there is demand for administration by trained experts, a stable differentiation where the official is privileged?

The person is usually appointed, but once in a while the bureaucrat is elected. But election of underlings can have consequences because of specialized knowledge.

The office is usually held for life. As a result, there is some type of independence. And rank is usually the basis for salary. There is also usually relatively fixed career lines.

## Monetary Presuppositions of Bureaucracy

You need a money economy! Sometimes others have control over budgets, because if the bureaucrats have money they might not spend it how other want. People may try to purchase the office as a source of income. Regardless, bureaucracies need a constant source of income to maintain it, which usually means stable taxation and a money economy.

## The Quantitative Development of Administrative Tasks

>The first such basis of bureaucratization has been the quantitative extension of administrative tasks. In politics, the big state and the mass party are the classic field of bureaucratization.

This is something like, the idea that large states and parties usually end up with bureaurcracies with lots of tasks.


## The Qualitative Changes of Administrative Tasks: The Impact of Cultural, Economic and Technological Developments

Depending on what the states want and how big the states are, the tasks of bureaucracy can vary.

## The Technical Superiority of Bureaucratic Organization over Administration by Notables

Bureaucracy has technical superiority over any other type of organization.It is precise, speedy and unambiguous.

>The more complicated and specialized modern culture becomes, the
more its external supporting apparatus demands the personally detached
and strictly objective expert, in lieu of the lord of older social structures.
who was moved by personal sympathy and favor, by grace and gratitude.
Bureaucracy offers the attitudes demanded by the external apparatus of
modern culture in the most favorable combination. In particular, only
bureaucracy has established the foundation for the administration of a
rational law conceptually systematized. on the basis of "statutes," p.975  

There is an argument about circumstancial situations versus an intense rationality.   This section builds out the difference between substantive justice and the formal rationality we get from bureaucracy. They unavoidably collide.

## Concentration of the Means of Administration
>The bureaucratic structure goes hand in hand with the concentration
of the material means of management in the hands of the master.
This concentration occurs, for instance, in a well-known and typical
fashion in the development of big capitalist enterprises, which find their
essential characteristics in this process. A corresponding process occurs
in public organizations. p. 980

For instance the army is bureaucratized, but so is the university. The state puts the whole expense on the budget, and the means are concentrated in the hands of a privileged head.


## Leveling of Social Differences

Bureaucracy usually only shows up in mass democracy, which calls for some kind of abstract exercise of authority and equality. This changes the way the demos is governed. Democracy requires:
1. No closed status group of officials and
2. Minimization of the authority of officialdom in the iterest of expanding the sphere of influence of public opinion.


## Objective and Subjective Bases of Bureaucratic Perpetuity

It is hard to get rid of bureaucracy.
>The individual bureaucrat cannot squirm out of the apparatus into which he has been harnessed...the professional bureaucrat is chained to his activity in his entire economic and ideological existence.

This is where it starts to sound dark. It is hard to get rid of bureaucracy because there is expert training involved.

>Increasingly, all order in public and private organizations is dependent
on the system of files and the discipline of officialdom, that means,
its habit of painstaking obedience within its wonted sphere of action.
The latter is the more decisive element, however important in practice
the files are. p.988

When people take over, or a new regime comes, the bureaucracy remains with a few different top officials.

>Such an apparatus makes "revolution," in the sense of the forcefd
creation of entirely new formations of authority, more and mare im~
possible-technically, because of its control over the modern means of
communication (telegraph etc.), and also because of its increasingly
,rationalized inner structure. The place of "revolutions" is under this
process taken by coups d'etat, as again France demonstrates in the
classical manner since all successful transformations there have been of
this nature. p.989

##  The Indeterminate Economic Consequences of Bureaucratization

Bureaucratization has far reaching consequences.

>The mere fact of bureaucratic organization
does not unambiguously tell us about the concrete direction
of its economic effects, which are always in some manner present. At
least it does not tell us as much as can be told about its relatively leveling
social effect. Even in this respect one has to remember that bureaucracy
as such is a precision instrument which can put itself at the disposal
of quite varied interests, purely political as well as purely economic
ones, or any other sort. Therefore, the measure of its parallelism with
democratization must not be exaggerated, however typical it may be. p.990

## The Power Position of the Bureaucracy

>that "democracy" as such is opposed to the "rule" of
bureaucracy, in spite and perhaps because of its unavoidable yet unintended
promotion of bureaucratization. Under certain conditions,
democracy creates palpable breaks in the bureauratic pattern and impediments
to bureaucratic organization. Hen(:e, one must in every individual
historical case analyze in which of the special directions bureaucratiza~
tion has there developed p.991

So, is the power of bureaucracy increasing in modern states? Here are the aspects of power:
1. Administrative Secrecy - It can hold onto some professional knowledge/secret.

>This tendency
toward secrecy is in certain administrative fields a consequence of
their objective nature: namely, wherever power interests of the given
structure of domination toward the outsitk are at stake, whether this
be the case of eq:cnomic com~titors of a private enterprise or that
of potentially hostile foreign polities in the public field. If it is to be
successful, the management of diplomacy can be publicly supervised
only to a very limited extent. p.992

2. The Ruler is Dependent on Bureaucracy

>Only the expert knowledge of private economic interest groups in
the field of "business" is superior to the expert knowledge of the
bureaucracy. This is so because the exact knowledge of facts in their
field is of direct significance for economic survival. Errors in official
statistics do not have direct economic consequences for the responsible
official, hut miscalculations in a capitalist enterprise are paid for by
losses, perhaps by its existence. Moreover, the "secret," as a means of
power, is more safely hidden in the books of an enterprise than it is in
the files of public authorities. For this reason alone authorities are held'
within narrow boundaries when they seek to inRuence economic life in
the capitalist epoch, and very frequently their measures take an unforeseen
and unintended course or are made illusory by the superior expert
knowledge of the intefested-groui-s. p.994

## Excursus on Collegiate Bodies and Interest Groups

Specialized knowledge of the expert is the foundation for power in bureaucracy. These are other bodies that influence some general leader other than bureaucracy I think. They also hold expert knowledge and can stand up to the bureaucrats.

>Only with the bureaucratization of the state and of law in general
can one see a ~e6nite possibility of a sharp conceptual separation of an
"objective" legal order from the "subjective" rights of the individual
which it guarantees, as well as that of the further distinction between
"public" law, which regulates the relationships of the public agencies
among each other and with the subjects, and "private" law which
regulates the relationships of the govemed individuals among themselves. p.998


## Bureaucracy and Education

There are usually some examinations or expertise, but the examinations can create a kind of privileged caste.
