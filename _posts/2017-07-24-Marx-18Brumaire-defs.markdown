Marx breaks down the french revolutions of the mid 1800's into three periods:
1. The February period
2. The period of the constituting of the republic
3. The period of constitutional republic

The first period starts with the overthrwo of the king. The government that took over admitted to being provisional. The proletariat fueled the uprising and called france a social republic. Old powers began to assemble themselves in opposition to the proletariat.

The second period is the foundation of the bourgeois republic, when they create the constitution. Here the revolution was drawn back to be only for teh bourgeois. In this bourgeois republic there is some widening of political freedom, but not to the extent desired by the proletrians. However, they do now role in the name of the people.

All of the classes rallied against the proletariat, who they thought of as the party of anarchy. I guess this is the reinstatement of the norm with slightly differnet ruling class interests.

>Th e Bonaparte dynasty
represents not the revolutionary, but the conservative peasant; not
the peasant that strikes out beyond the condition of his social existence,
the small holding, but rather the peasant who wants to consolidate
it; not the country folk who want to overthrow the old
order through their own energies linked up with the towns, but on
the contrary those who, in stupefied bondage to this old order, want
to see themselves with their small holding saved and favoured by
the ghost of the empire. It represents not the enlightenment, but
the superstition of the peasant; not his judgment, but his prejudice;
no t his future, but his past; not his modern Cevennes, 6 but his
modern Vendee. p.609

>This contradictory task of the man explains the contradictions of
his government, the confused groping hither and thither which
seeks now to win, now to humiliate first one class and then another
and arrays all of them uniformly against him, whose practical uncertainty
forms a highly comical contrast to the imperious categorical
style of the government decrees, a style which i s copied obsequiously
from the Uncle . p.615
