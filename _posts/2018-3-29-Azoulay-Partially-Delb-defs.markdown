title:  "Azoulay et. al - Social Influence Given Partially Deliberate Matching"

Abstract: "Actors and associates often match on a few dimensions that matter
most for the relationship at hand. In so doing, they are exposed to unanticipated
social influences because counterparts have broader attitudes
and preferences than would-be contacts considered when they
first chose to pair. The authors label as “partially deliberate” social
matching that occurs on a small set of attributes, and they present empirical
methods for identifying causal social influence effects when relationships
follow this generative logic. A data set tracking the training
and professional activities of academic biomedical scientists is
used to show that young scientists adopt their advisers’ orientations
toward commercial science as evidenced by adviser-to-advisee transmission
of patenting behavior. The authors demonstrate this in twostage
models that account for the endogeneity of matching, using both
inverse probability of treatment weights and an instrumental variables
approach. They also draw on qualitative methods to support
a causal interpretation. Overall, they present a theory and a triangulation
of methods to establish evidence of social influence when tie formation
is partially deliberate."

The idea is that individuals match on a small set of characteristics and then are influenced w.r.t others.
>If people deliberately match on a subset of carefully considered
(or merely convenient) dimensions, we are then exposed to unanticipated
social influences when we encounter the views and tastes that never
entered our calculus when we chose a particular interaction p.1224

Between postdocs and mentors, we see matching based on location and scientific interest.

And then we look at wehther the adviser was a patenter.
>Therefore, the evidence suggests that the transmission
of patenting behavior truly is a causal social influence, rather than stemming
from common commercial interests or other latent similarities that
underlie the initial candidate-adviser match 1225

There is a lot of work done here - coded oral transcripts, dyad-level matching regression, propensity score estimation to assess the effect, and then a heckman selection model.


Whenw e think about diffusion, causal estimation is so difficult. Homophily and social influence have a time related element to it.

>Beginning with the former—the inception of new relationships—
a rich body of work has illuminated the guiding hand of social similarity
in social interaction. Lazarsfeld and Merton (1954) and Blau (1977)
develop the social foundations that lead us to anticipate homophilous interaction 1227

There is nonrandomness in social relationships. However, if they match on a small set of characteristics, there is hope that we can look at transmission with respect to some other one.  

We can be pretty certain that postdocs are matching with advisers based on geography and interest, and patenting plays pretty much no role at all (except i guess if it correlates with scientific interest?)

But they do check for patentability of research.

There is an unexpected findinng that distance in terms of scientific interests seems to create a larger treatment effect.

>Having established the basic social influence result, we next ask whether adviser
patenting has any effect on other scholar-level career outcomes, such
as publication and citation rates. The motivation for these analyses is that
if postdoc adviser patenting affects career outcomes that are unrelated to
commercial activities, we might worry that mentor patenting has an effect
only because it captures some unobserved dimension of scholar talent that
makes scientists more likely to succeed,p.1260
