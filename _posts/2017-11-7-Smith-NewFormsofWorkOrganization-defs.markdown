title:  "Smith - New Forms of Work Organization"

Abstract: "A growing body of social science literature has examined the organizational innovations
and staffing practices comprising new flexible forms of work. Researchers
have investigated the depth and scope of these changes and questioned how they
affect diverse groups of workers in the United States. Reviewing the research on
this transformation reveals a model of combined and uneven flexibility, characterized
by the opening of opportunities that are differentially distributed across
different groups of American workers, emerging under conditions in which effort
is intensified, control is decentered, and employment is destabilized. The essay
concludes by suggesting additional areas of inquiry for sociologists concerned
with new forms of work organization."

>A growing body of social science literature has examined the organizational innovations

Really what we're seeing here is the development of systems of flexible work. Some think flexible work will improve the ways people work and serve each other, and will better align workers interests with those of their managers. This is because people flatten rigid bureaucracies, trim excessive organizational resources.

Critics say this flexibility doesn't change the way people are controlled. Some say this will erode power at work.

Really there are two elements in flexibility. The first is functional flexiblity, and this flexible work builds in more meployee involvement. Heere you get deeper involvement of core workers. Numerical flexibility refers to more contingent jobs and workers.

We begin with post war 1950's the standard american utopia. Production during this period was set in its ways and others did not have to compete.

>Early on, theorists of flexible specialization
(Piore & Sabel 1984) argued that work systems that tapped craft
knowledge, increased participation, and provided continual training would enable
workers on the shop floor to specialize flexibly and to vary their product
lines rapidly and with high quality. Others focused on new manufacturing systems
(Hirschhorn 1984) powered by advances in cybernetic technology that
were driving, if not requiring, employers to adopt more flexible ways of organizing
workers. p.318

This is reminiscent of, for instance Just-In-Time production or other Japanese models from the time. A core expection was that flexible systems would privlege workers knowledge above supervisors knowledge. This would combat alienation in mass production, making the work more meaningful.

But it is unclear whether this really worked with respect to control, consent etc. IN Just In Time workers are on a much stricter deadline, and the labor process is more intesnive. These people were rarely paid more.

It is clear though that Smith sees flexible work as the POSSIBLY next stage. The bureaucratic red tape that on the one hand allows workers to consent and to understand company policy on the other hand becomes so intense that managers cannot get the right work out of workers (maybe).

Self management perhaps brings more possibility to break down hierarchy. "Theoretically the spread of teams suggests a deep-seated reworking of the division of labor, although the literature suggests a range of effects that fall short of that potential" But this is not really the case.

>Managementsâ€™ commitments to
teams may be largely ceremonial, a nod paid to the normative model of flexibility,
which obscures the reality that teams have little power (Graham 1995)
or are organized top-down by managers (Vallas & Beck 1996). When a teambased,
flattened organizational model of primary nursing was introduced in a
large hospital, nurses experienced heightened job autonomy and reunification
of tasks, but simultaneously they found that their jobs became greatly intensified
and that they came under greater scrutiny by managers (Brannon 1994). p.325

The control in team based work is decentered and less visible.

But flexibility also moves from the organization of work itself to the number of workers hired. There are more temporary and part-time jobs. This part is terrible.

>Whereas temporary workers have long been used to fill in for sick
or vacationing workers, only recently have employers been hiring temporaries
in massive numbers to fill formerly permanent positions. Temporary work now
constitutes one of the fastest growing segments of the labor force (Plunkert &
Hayghe 1995). The temporary help services industry has been a significant
source of job growth in the 1990s (Gardner et al 1994) and will continue to lead
job growth into the twenty-first century (Franklin 1995). p.13

But flexibility in this sense differentiates itself in a number of ways.


## Conclusion
>The new model combines elements of the two but in different
configurations, playing different groups of workers off one another, eliciting
participation from some by denying participative opportunities to others. Thus
the two sets of changes discussed in this essay are integrally bound up with
one another, although they paradoxically continually undermine one another as
well. p.332

IF anyone is truly benefiting from flexible reorganization of work, it is only because they are buffered by a flexible work force.
