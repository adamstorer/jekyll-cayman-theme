title:  "Smith - New Forms of Work Organization"
date:   2017-11-7 17:50:00
categories: ['Smith','Work QE','Reading Notes','Annual Reviews']
published: true
Abstract: "A growing body of social science literature has examined the organizational innovations
and staffing practices comprising new flexible forms of work. Researchers
have investigated the depth and scope of these changes and questioned how they
affect diverse groups of workers in the United States. Reviewing the research on
this transformation reveals a model of combined and uneven flexibility, characterized
by the opening of opportunities that are differentially distributed across
different groups of American workers, emerging under conditions in which effort
is intensified, control is decentered, and employment is destabilized. The essay
concludes by suggesting additional areas of inquiry for sociologists concerned
with new forms of work organization."

Really what we're seeing here is the development of systems of flexible work. Some think flexible work will improve the ways people work and serve each other, and will better align workers interests with those of their managers. This is because people flatten rigid bureaucracies, trim excessive organizational resources.

Critics say this flexibility doesn't change the way people are controlled. Some say this will erode power at work.

Really there are two elements in flexibility. The first is functional flexiblity, and this flexible work builds in more meployee involvement. Heere you get deeper involvement of core workers. Numerical flexibility refers to more contingent jobs and workers.
