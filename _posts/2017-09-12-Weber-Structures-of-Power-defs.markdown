# The Prestige and Power of the Great Powers

Political structures are different, some strive to expand while others do not. "As structures of power, political organizations vary in the extent to which they are turned outward." That is, they can be somewhere between isolations and expansive.

People may claim a special prestige for being particularly expansive. This prestige is a claim to power, and claims to power are particularly important, for instance in starting wars.  

Feudal lords want to add more power and then most prestige based on this power. Bureaucrats and offices see the expansion of powers as an opportunity for promotion.

But all groups strive for some kind of prestige.

>The prestige of power, as such, means in practice the glory of power
over other communities; it means the expansion of power, though not
always by way of incorporation or subjection. The big poHtical communities
are the natural exponents of such pretensions to prestige.

# Economic Foundations of Imperialism

One might make the argument that this is pretty much ane conomic thing, but not really. This is because prestige on its own can have as much of an effect as the economy.

HOwever, nations are often unified in a domestic economic market. While economics and trade do not always determine everything, they may play a role in how expansion takes place. People often want "ground rent" or money you can extract by owning a place.

Lots of profit opportunities exist for imperialist capitalism - for instance conquering and enslaving a group as plantation labor.

These offer the best opportunities for profit. Even better than a pacifist funciton economy (sometimes) is an imperialist economy, but this is a gamble as well. The more private interests effect politics, the more likely imperialist capitalism will seem important.

>The safest way of guaranteeing these monopolized profit opportunities
to the members of one's own polity is to occupy it or at least to subject
the foreign political power in the form of a 'protectorate' or some such
arrangement. Therefore, this 'imperialist' tendency increasingly displaces
the 'pacifist' tendency of expansion; which aims merely at 'freedom of
trade.' p.169

If it was a state-socialist community, we would likely see the same time of imperialism.

Rich people might go to war but poor people have a lot to lose. Why would they work in such a way?

>The 'masses' as such, at least
in their, subjective conception and in the extreme case, have nothing
concrete to lose but their lives. The valuation and effect of this danger
strongly fluctuates in their own minds. On the whole, it can easily be
reduced to zero through emotional influence.

# The Nation
People can have a desire to go to war without the economic influence if there is some emotional influence that stems from some idea of a nation.

For instance, if the masses tae the political prestige of the nation as important, and may see it as providing for future generations, they may do so. From power we may get all sorts of types of prestige, and the biggest one is the nation.

National solidarity is based mostly around some idea of a nation, or trying to make sense of some national sentiments with respect to the sentiments of others. People see the significance of the nation as tied to some idea of superiority of the values of their group in contrast to those of some other group.

Whatever the nation is, it seems to be really a political idea that brings people together. Sometimes popular language plays a role.
