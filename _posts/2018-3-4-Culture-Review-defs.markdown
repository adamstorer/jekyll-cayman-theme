CULTURE REVIEW

# Boundaries
## Gieryn - Boundary Work
* We use boundaries to make sense of what science is.
* We are solving problems of demarcation that are bound with questions about resource and legitimacy
* Professional ideologies of Science have two different types - Parsons thinks of ideology as a way to integrate conflicting/competing demands and expectations. Marx thinks of ideology as ways of manipulating people to further interests.
* The relationship between science and ideology is an interesting relationship. We see that ideology needs a foil, something that IS NOT in order to determine what is.
* We can expect boundary work to be a tool people use when there is a goal of expansion over other domains, monopolization over amateurs, and when there is a goal of autonomy.
* Sciences boundaries are drawn depending on what those who purport to do it want to gain from it.

## Goldberg - Span Culture Boundaries
* We understand that categorical boundaries are symbolic distinctions, but why do people span boundaries. When do people decide this is in or out?
* We see two types of spanning - atypicality and variety. People may develop tastes for atypicality or variety,
* Atypicality is more likely to be found in liking something that is made for multiple genres.

## Lamont and Molnar - Study of Boundaries in the Social Sciences
* In building obundaries, people leverage symbolic resources  in order to build symbolic boundaries.
* Symbolic Boundaries are conceptual distinctions made by actors to categorize objects etc.
* Social Boundaries - Objectified forms of socail difference manifested in distribution of resources.
* We see this in the us vs them, but also in class, race, and gender divides.

## Pachuki - Boundary Processes
* Staying with symbolic and social boundaries, they basically look at the ways in which we have used these to continue thinking about how the world works.
* I'm not sur ethere are many new ideas at play here.

# MOTIVATION
## Mills - Situated Actions and Vocabulary of Motives
* There are two ways of looking at motives - explain behavior by referring it to an inferred motive, or analyze the observable speech as they function
* But motive imputation is really hard - we know that action is social, and it is difficult to try and bring something individual out of something social.
* Really we think of motives as accepted justification of present, future, or past acts
* But really, the verbalization of the act and the doing of the thing are two separate things.
* WE really cannot see anything other than those verballizations.
* So in the end There is no explanatory value in subsuming various vocabularies of motives under some terminology or list. Such procedure merely confuses the task of explaining specific cases. The languages of situations as given must be considered a valuable portion of the data to be interpreted and related to their condi- tions. To simplify these vocabularies of motive into a socially abstracted terminology is to destroy the legitimate use of motive in the explanation of social actions. People don't have x or y motivation, the way they talk abut motivations is situational and we have to make sense of the situation as well as the motive.

## Vaisey - Motivation and Justification
* What role do cultural meanings play in people's behavior?
* We used to think people were motivated by values
* Swidler presents Tool Kit theory, where we have internalized strategies of action that we can bring to bear on everyday problems.
* The justification process is something like this - People pursue consistent lines of action, but give contradictory accounts. Their accounts cannot really be motivating, the true springs of action must be OUTSIDE OF SUBJECTIVITY.
* IN addition, people are in situational contexts where they develop patterns
* Something else drives action, and culture makes sense of things after the fact.
* Vaiseys cognitive scheme is that actors are driven primarily by deeply internalized schematic processes, but they are also capable of deliberation and justification when required by the demands of social interaction. This is the dual process theory.

## Swidler - Talk of Love
* Swidler has the metaphor of repertoires - a big bag of tricks. How do people select among a set of repertoires? There is kind of a patchwork of meaning.
* Cultural Repertories allow people to move among situations - finding terms in which to orient action within each situation.
* You may have some deeply held understandings, and you use different tools in making sense of things.
* Some change frames in the middle of a discussion - often times in love, people vary in how they draw upon repertoires, how many and how they relate to poeple.
* What do people use culture for - as a circle of goals and means where perception and cognition are phases of action. People develop lines of action  and try and make sense of some deep rooted notions of who they think they are.
* For Swidler, we have some stories about who we think we are and we stick to them - we use these stories to act, but if we find that our actions are not totally lined up with who we think we are then we try out multiple justifications.
* In unsetlled lives, people try out new strategies of action, and in settled lives people don't really think about things too much.
* How embedded are people - there are levels where people are open to rethinking their actions, and common sense when they are not.
* And institutions might bring people's cultural ideas together.
* We end with two questions - how deeply or coherently is culture internalized and how powerfully does it influence action.

## Hitlin and Piliavin - Values Reviving a Domant Concept
* Values mean different things but maybe - Concepts or beliefs about desirable states/behaviors that transcend specific situations, which guide selection or evaluation of behavior and are ordered by relative importance.  
* Maybe there are some terminal values which guide everything else.
* The value types make up some crazy phenomenlogy.

## Macleod - Ain't No Makin It
* Occupational aspirations are related to class lines
* That is, people do not see certain things as possilbe and therefore don't go for them I htink.
* This is part of how social reproduction is lived out.
* We see different groups with different types of aspirations. The white kids seem to think things are pointless and break out from the mainstream, while the black kids accept the mainstream.
* This is partly because of the way that they learn to act from their parents.
* Families influence individual aspirations by making certain things seem attainable. Subgroup ideas can vary from main group ideas.
* This book’s basic finding—that two substantially different paths are followed within the general framework of social reproduction—is a major challenge to economically determinist theories. Two groups of boys from the same social stratum who live in the same housing project and attend the same school nevertheless experience the process of social reproduction in fundamentally different ways p.137

# Narratives
## Sewell - Historical Events as Transformations of Structures
* Structures are both the medium and the outcome of the practices which constitutes social system.
* Structures overlap - they are unevenly articulated
* Structures are composed of schemas, resources, and power.
* Schemas provide meanings and movitivations, resources provide schemas with the means and stakes of action, and power regulates action.
* Events should be conceived as a sequence of occurrences that result in transformations of structures. They begin with a rupture.
* An event must not only be a sequence of occurrences, it must be recognized by contemporaries and result in durable transformation of structures.

## Loeske - The Study of Identit as Cultural Institutional Organization and Personal Narratives
* We make sense of our own lives primarily through storytelling - that is our deep believes are partially identified throug stories
* There are really different types of stories we tell, at different levels
* Culture, we tell storeis and we transfer culture based on them.
* Insitutional, we tell stories about greedy lawyers, etc. They create types of things that need to be addressed.
* Organizational Identity - Organizers tell stories about who they serve.
* Personal Narrative - They create some coherent notion of who you are.
* Perhaps there is some reflexivity.

## Poletta - It was Like a Fever
* We might tell a story that starts with some sudden decision to do something, but really it was an organized effort.
* The narrative of spantaneity is a frame to establish a movement
* If you are framing the protest as a spontaneous thing then it means you can get involved.
* The difference between narrative frames is that frames clear things up, stories leave things to the imagination.
* A narrative of spontaneity helps, maybe, to create new actors

## Abbott - From Causes to Events
* Current "Sociology" thinks to much about causes - we parse reality into bits and think about how they interact. We do not think about process.
* Using different types of analysis, we can get to a process story where there is an order of events that end somewhere.

# Economic Systems and Culture
## Lamont - Money Morals and Manners
* In France and America, people draw different boundaries around what is good and bad, what they like and don't like. For instance, in America people think hard workers are moral, but in France sometimes they think people who work too hard are suckers. In France they care about general competence whereas in the US they care about specialized expertise.
* People draw symbolic boundaries based on moral character, social position such as wealth, power and profession, and cultural boundaries based on intelligence, manners, and tastes.
* People stress socieconomic and moral boundaries in the US, and moral and cultural in France.

## Biernacki - Fabrication of Labor
* People thought of labor in different ways in Britain and Germany
* In England people thought of exchange as selling your labor on the market - you were most closely tied to what you produced.
* In Germany, you were really selling your time - and this was manifested in the ways in which they measured prodctivity.
* But the practices in the factories shifted the problems that people thought they had.
* This is meant to show the cause of culture in influencing other changes.
* German owners and workers viewed employment as the timed appropriation of workers’ labor power and disposition over workers’ labor activity. In contrast, British owners and workers saw employment as the appropriation of workers’ materialized labor via its products. These divergent assumptions led to differences in the definition of wages, the calculation of costs, rights of employment, disciplinary fines, and the design of factory buildings. Since the manufacturing practices in each country formed a meaningful constellation, my positive argument is configurational, attached to an overarching pattern of techniques p.12
* The difference in thoguhts about labor as prices on a market and labor as extraction of surplus value comes from the differnt ways that they ended up conceptualizing work in Germany and Britian. You can see it on the weaving shop floor where the design pay scales were based on different criteria. In England you got payed by the lenght/density of the cloth (the product) and in Germany you got paid for the number of shots per shuttle (the labor).
* This institution guides the way that people think about their problems.
* We also see it in terms of the control of time measurements - Germans were concerned with how efficient workers were in a way that British people couldn't make sense of.

# States and Culture
## Eliasoph - Political Culture and the Presentation of the Self
* To understand how people think about politics, you have to make sense of the people in reality, not in a survey. This is to ask - what is the relation between a person and their political opinions. The way we frame our interview gives people different ways of speaking. Eliasoph used a radio interview.
* Eliasoph develops ways of categorizing people in order to understand the ways that they relate to politcs and political opinions - do they use sarcasm or intense statements to distance themselves, or do they claim no knowledge?
* IN this type of interview we might get more context and a more real way of understanding how political discussions take place.

## Skocpol - Cultural Idioms and Political Ideologies
* When trying to change things, no single group deliberately shapes the complex conflicts that bring about revolutionary crises or utcomes.
* Class structures and conflicts are not the only structural keys - we need to focus on international relationships.
* But social revolutions are ideologically inspired projects - not class projects.
* But Sewell believes thinks systematcially change, but the world is more complex. So we have more things that people play on
* Ideology - a system of ideas depoloyed by actors
* CUltural Idioms - longer term more anonymous, less partisan ideas that can strucure things in new ways.
* the analysis of cultural idioms and ideologies in social revolutions deserves treatment analogous to the analysis of class relations and class conflicts

## Harzing - Planned Change in Organizations - The Influence of National Culture
* Organizations in different countries have different problems based on different notions of certain cultural values in different countries.
* Organizations are influenced by contingency, choice and culture. Contigency is the circumstances in the moment, there are also the strategic choices of managers, but there is also different national ways of thinking fof things.
* They come down to values that are big ideas like Power Distance, Individualism, and Masculinity, and surveys show that there is regionality in people's answers to these questions. And people's answers to these questions determine how resistant they are to change.
* National cultures also come with different change strategies.

## Schalet - Not Under My Roof
* In american society we think about sexuality differently - we want to stop people from having sex, whereas in the Netherlands people are much more open to discussing sex with their families.
* There are some structural reasons - americans are more religious and the dutch have free contraceptives.
* But also, there are different ways of thinking about gender and sexuality.
* Culture is all about changing how people conceptualizing themselves, the controlling aspect as well as the constitutive aspect of culture.
* The Americans dramatize while the dutch normalize. Part of it is because the Americans see love as an individualistic thing where we stand apart from society, whereas in the netherlands we see individual and society as mutually constitutive.
* Adverseraarial individualism encourages individuals to attain autonomy from breaking away. You need to be on your own and break away from your family to be an individual.
* Adversarial indiviudalism requires external control, self-sufficiency, and picking important battles in give and take
* Interdependent individuals asks teens to develop internal control, and asks teens to regulate themselves. Authority is a continuous mutual agreement.
* This leads to a sexuality that is either dramatized or normalized. s

# Fields

## Bourdieu - Fields of Cultural Production
* Fields are all about relational thinking, position taking in different groups
* We have a field of forces and struggles, and we mus tthink of art as a field.
* Here the field has internal dynamics
* There is real position takings based on different types of capital.
* THe artistic field is relatively autonomous but in the end is dominated by the field of power.
* Symbolic power in art is really the misrecognition of economic power.
* There is a struggle for the definition of the dominant actors int he field
* We have oppositions based on placement in a field. There are sub-fields related to large scale production and to production for a restricted population, usuaully otherproducers. The structure of the field of cultural production is based on two different oppositiosn. 1 Oppositions between subfields o restricted production and amss production, that is two economies and audiences etc. 2) Within the sub field of the restricted population, between the established figures and the newcomers.
* Usually even the people who turn away from mass production are in the best position to do so.

## Dimaggio - Did I read this earlier
* Studies tend to focus on local diffusion, but we had field wide diffusion in the construction of art museums.
* We saw in the construction fo the field the deligitimation of things that existed before, the old museums
* There are some general processes where we draw the idea of new organizations.

# Organizations
## Dobbin - Cultural MOdels of Organization
* People think of orgs and bureaucracies as social structures that are effected by cutlure.
* Some say organizations are not culture
* Some said organizations are culture, because they don't act rationally. They say one thing and do another.
* But we should really think about the cultural phenomena in which categories and practices develop.

## Vaughan - The Challenger Launch Decision
* Organizations were not amoral calculators doing things based on deadlines
* A specific practice, determining acceptable risk, (a cultural ritual) became patterend and firmly set in the ways that people thought about risk at NASA.
* Work group culture was such that two different groups were often at odds with each other over data, and usually the one with the best evidence would prevail.
* There were sometimes differences based on the evidence, and they categorized the differences as acceptable risks.
* Acceptable risk was a way to deal with technological uncertainty.
* Disputes between work groups were moved up the chain of command, but in the end we basically had higher up people deciding if something was an acceptable risk.
* As new problems showed up, rather than reconceptualizing the task as such, it got lumped in as an acceptable risk!
* Basically, even though they knew there was a potential for catastrophic failure, the risk became normalized over time through a series of assumptions.

## Kunda - Engineering Culture
* Businesses use culture to create a type of person, and individuals have to make sense of how similar they are to this type of person, the "good worker" that they are supposed to be.
* The idea of the good worker is impressed upon them in multiple ways.
* However, the lower down you are, the less you are concerned with the role of the good worker, you do not have any difficulty with it.
* The higher up you are, the more you have to conform to the role, and the less you believe in it.
* For full members, the extensive demands provide a deilemna - The higher up you rise in the system the more you are faced with the ideology of tech culture. One must show htemselves to be behaviorally the same as other high status members. It seems as though the price of power is submission.
* This is a higher demand on the self
* That is, there is not really a continuance of attachment and detachment from the role. The role is not really applied to the lower members and the higher members experience both issues.
* They are subjects and agents of normative control who relate to the ideology with some septicism.
* Really, there are different control mechanisms at different levels. Higher up people are subjected to noramtive control, while some are subjected to utilitarian or coercive control.

## Pettigrew - On Studying Organizational Cultures
* Within an organization, we can study the process of culture
* This means understanding how entrepreneurs build an ideology connecting discourse and action
* Then, understand how they deal with commitment by utilizing the culture.
* This means employing rituals, shifting language, etc.

# Networks
## Erickson - Culture, Class and Connections
* Bourdieu doesn't talk enough about social capital
* It is not necessarily true that the highest class has the most distinguished culture.
* But culture can be a resources to coordinate, rather than dominate, your employees.
* For most businesses, highbrow culture is pretty much irrelevant.
* So some genres can reproduce gaps, but some genres can bridge gaps.
* The more network variety leads to cultural variety, the more that culture can actually bridge gaps.

## Friedkin - Structural Bases of Interpersonal Influence
* To make someone do something, you need to have resources that are valuable to people.
* To influence someone socially, you need a problem to be visible and salient.
* This means interpersonal communication, being central in a network, in terms of structural cohesion and centrality, get people to do things.
* The argument is that, if you are in a dense network or if you are in the middle of the network, you are more likely to be able to influence people to see things in certain ways.

## Lizardo - How Cultural Tastest Shape Personal Networks
* Cultural Tastest are used to form and sustain networks
* Highbrow taste forms smaller network ties than lowbrow tastee
* So, highbrow taste should leave you in a dense isolated network.
* Lowbrow taste should bring you lots of weak ties.

## Dellaposta- Why do Liberals Drink Lattes
* Social Influence and Homophily mean that small seeds of practice can spread in groups and create a lot of insulated similarity.

## Emirbayer and Goodwin - Network Analysis, Culture and Agency
* Network analyis puts relations over categories
*
## LIzardo and Skyles - Reconceptualizing Omnivorousness
* Some peopel say omnivorousness means Bourdieu was wrong
* Really, omnivorousness shows a high class aesthetic disposition, where high class people are more daring
* You need to learn more to learn how to appreciate more things, and you can also take chances on things that might become popular later.
