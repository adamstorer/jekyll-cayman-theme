# Paul Zivich
What is vaccine effectiveness? Direct - Risk of D in vaccinated compared to risk of D in unvaccinated? Indirect - Risk of D per one unit increase in vaccination coverage

We're also doing network stuff - node, etc.

The problem is it's hard to make sense of what is indirect vs what is direct. So the idea is to demonstrate the bias.

exFlue -- clustered randomized trial on three day self isolation on reducing spread of the flu among university students.

This difference between direct and indirect could be interesting in my situation -

# Nina Yamanis - Social Influence Effects of Men's HIV Testing during a Randomized Controlled Intervention in Tanzania

Men have low rates of HIV testing in subsaharan Arica - premature mortality and ongoing HIV transmission. Women have higher rates of HIV than men in this area. Men's testing is super important.

So how do social networks influence things? THey create what is normative.
Peer norms are super behavior in this setting

The social networks are calle d"camps" which are essentially closed social networks. They are also very stable, and have around 32 people, and have rosters/elected leaders.

Identified 205 camps - that had 20-80 members and existed for over a year. They clostered the camps eographically and chose the cluters randomly. The DV is "have you been tested for HIV in the last year"

They have many different networks/closest friends networks. They tried to get at norms in HIV testing - has this friend ever have an HIV test - about friends getting tested or friends saying you should get tested.
They use RSiena to try and contorl for selection

# Mariano Kanamori - Expanding Social NetworkVisiaulizatio

Latinos have the highest rate of HIV in miami   

# Lindsay Young - Network and communication properties of HIV prevention and risk engagement in an online social networking environment

Therea re 50k new HIV infections each year, and MSM's have them the most - and there are more disparities - Black is the hgihgest and then lation's and whites. The people who get thema re young.

General purpose social networks - What are the normative pathways thorugh which partner seeking occurs?

Network configurations can be based on how networks work (popular networks attarct more people) - and exogenous factors - such as the properties of indiviudals within the netowkr.

The parameters that we are interested in/need to model are edge parameters - are young msms who engage in certain behavior more likely to belong in fb groups?...

Are there individuals who share common traits that tend to cluster around a common set of fb groups - the potential for norms to emerge where individuals whoa re similarly motivated. HIV positive people are more likely tob e on FB groups - but not to secret groups. Those who did group sex are lower to be in FB groups.

# Will McConnell - Egocentric Network Analysis of Older Adults Coping with the Onset of Alzheimer's Disease

Egocentric network analysis i sdifferent, in between hardcore network analysis and regular statistics

How do people in similar positions end up dealing with their relationships (network data without people knowing each other)

New responsibilities and burdens

Alzheimers - we are having more poeple getting this thing - it is inherently debilitating -

Are there social intervention factors that help people deal with this stuff.  There is research for instance on caregivers, who play essential roles. Providers say that individuals are discharged to family.

So he has these people hwo have or are afraid of getting alzheimers - Important matters - GSS.  

Alternative name generator - a functionally specific name generator is also useful for dealing with the headless frogs. This is nested data - we have network memebers in patients - and you can use multilevel models to figure it out

Once people have dementia you lose  weak ties  and your networks get closer. And they all know each other - they are all dense networks.
Then we can look at quality of life based on network characteristsics - FOR PEOPLE with normal cognition, quality of life does not matter for quality of life, but if you have problems and knowledgable friends you're ok, but no knowledgeable friends and you're bummed.

Older adults shows that there is a notion that there is a true support system. We still do not know if networks are changing as a result of illness or what's going on there

# Adam Roth - Informal Caregiving and Network Turnover among Older Adults
Social networks change over the life course
Caregiving is a big informal netowrk, and there is negative otucomes on health and well-being.

FOr caregivers - do they have different networks  i sther enetwork turnover - HOw does the transition into informal caregiving relate to quality o life in terms of networks.

Adults who move into caregiving are going to lose, but htey may also add.

We see people transitioning into caregiving lose and add at higher rates.

# Alyssa Goldman - Early-LIfe Origins of Later-LIfe Networks

HOw are early life circumstances associated with social network structure and stability in later life? And how does thi relate to health/depression?

How do early life things focus on network structure/stability - and higly correlated with social support etc

Social network structure and stability is important for all sorts of reasons looking at health outcomes.
