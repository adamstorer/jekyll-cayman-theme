    Control: The ability of capitalists andor managers to obtain desired work behavior from workers.
    What are the three elements of a system of control?: Direction, Evaluation and Discipline
    What are the three types of control for Edwards: Simple, Technical and Bureaucratic
    What is Simple Control and how did it change?: A single owner with a small group of managers. Personal power is exercised often, intervening in labor processes often to admonish or reward workers. There is little structure and work is frustratingly arbitrary. Eventually greater planning of work, employing large amounts of people with growing levels of foreman. Petty tyranny changes from the entrepreneur themselves to middle managers. Workers resist.
    What is Technical Control?: Employers attempt to control production. We get the assembly line or scientific management. In large firms we often still see technical control. The machines themselves seem to control the work. However, connecting labor to the assembly line gives labor a real opportunity to resist.
    What is Bureaucratic Control?: Embed control in the social structure or the social relations of the workplace. Company policy allowing individuals to move up, or which evaluate workers based on their performance keeps wokrers in line. Company policy also shows managers exactly how to work. But the promise of a career, the promise to stick with a company, keeps workers in line.
    How does Edwards see systems of control developing: Each transformation of systems of control occur as a resolution of intensifying conflict and contradiction  in the firms operations. Once instituted, new relations persist until they no longer effectively contain workers.

Capitalism is all about labor power, and the management of labor power. Capitalists are invested in converted labor power into actual labor, and there are a few different strategies for this.

But the way that labor is organized has different impacts on production not only through science but through the social relations that govern individual work. Conflict in the labor process occurs often and is specific to different contexts.

One issue capitalists have is resistance, and so they attempt to organize work to minimize resistance or alter workers' perceptions of the desirability of opposition. "Work has been organized, then, to contain conflict." p.16


## Dimensions of Control
Work is based on control.

Systems of control coordinate three elements:
1. Direction
2. Evaluation
3. Discipline

Edwards is concerned with three different types of control:

As different sectors develop (unevenly), there will be different types of control at any one time. If people are part of different systems of control, then they are broekn apart as a class.

Edwards dives into a history of control but the argument is really all there in the introduction.

Importantly, after the collapse of simple control, the two problems showed themselves - a problem for the production staff and for the nonproduction staff. Taylorism seemed to show some promise as the production staff.

There was a lot of experimentation with control, for instance by giving individuals stakes in the company or bribing workers to work more by giving them non work things. This, edwards calls "Welfare Capitalism" and it didn't work. Welfare capitalism used positive incentives to attract worker loyalty rather than relying on sanction, and make the rewards stand in some systematic relation to each employee's behavior. It failed because it did not deal with power WITHIN the firm. They are treating the employees like crap but giving them more stuff, but they did not deal with RELATIONS IN THE WORKPLACE.  Scientific Management was also an attempt to respond to problems with corporate control. But it was kind of too complicated for businesses to really do. Most didn't even want to try it. Also, standing over workers with stop watches would be awful for the worker.

Taylorism also didn't work because the crisis of control was in full view, and it made workers mad. BUt it gave us separation of conception from execution. And it showed that foremen needed to be reigned in somehow. And, rational organization of work can pay dividends.

There were also some company specific unions/work counciles, but this didn't really work either.  The formal grievance procedures left the power still obviously in the hands of the employer. There were not really any bargaining mechanisms, there was not an established method to show collective disapproval or collective bargaining.  


The problem is that each form of control takes place within the same standard of living. If it gets bad enough people seem content to take what they can get? BUt at the same time work is much more routinized and directed, though it is perhaps more individual?

## Segemented Labor Markets
Some argue there are really three labor markets - a secondary market, a subordinate primary market, and the independent primary market. The differences in the market are really differences in the types of jobs.  In the secondary market there is casual labor and service work, there is no training and the jobs.

The idea is that different jobs provide different benefits based partially on the bureaucratic structuring of labor (maybe) and that these different types of jobs lead to workers who have a hard time identifying with each other. People are in three different labor markets, and these labor markets have different outcomes and different processes. Edwards argues labor markets are
>Labor Markets are segmented because they express a historical segemnation of the labor process; specifically, a distinct stystem of control inside the firm underlies each of the three market segments.

The secondary labor market is simple control. Subordinate labor markets have technical control and sometimes unions. The independent primary labor market is all about bureaucracy.

Edwards argues structural control (technical+bureaucratic) ends up beating workers usually. However, it moves a lot of argument to the political sphere in terms of what is or is not unfair. If this is the case, then the political sphere could be a problem for capitalism.



Notes from Class:
Edwards says Taylorism was not nearly as influential as it seems. It often led to vivid and distinct moments of resistance. In the hidden abode of production is where we can understand what is shaping jobs in the contemporary period,  but Braverman shouldn’t have just assumed that Taylor comes. Capitalists care about profits, not the separation of execution vs conception.

In the early years of competitive capitalism, we see there is largely simple/hierarchical control where you have the employer (or their agents) evaluation, coordinating, and disciplining based on their own ideas aned experience. There is a lot of cultural authority (if you have an employer who used to make this)

This breaks down as firms get larger  and gets foreman BECAUSE WORKERS EXPERIENCE IT AS ARBITRARY.

There is an internal contradiction

Then there is an experimentation period where you try to get these larger profits, taylorism, welfare capitalism. Throughout this experimentation they come up with technical and then bureaucratic control.

Technical control is where the speed and how you do the task is determined by the machine. It’s clear if people are doin their jobs or not.

There’s a flaw there, it all goes fine for a while, but since everything is dependent on these choke points if you can resist with focus on the chokeholds then you can really collectively reassert some control over their own labor.

With technical control workers have many of the same kinds of complainst because their interests become much more similar.

But technical control is problematic – the real obvious problems of hierarchical control lead to bureaucratic control. You establish clear rules and you get people to establish these rules, how fast or how slow you need to work.

This is why the working class is so fragmented, because thy are separated control.


Is the bureaucratic control the most controlling because you internalize it.
