Maybe we should see the world in a more integrated, hybridized way. That is, there is some connection between facts, power and discourse, that is not objective or social, not effects of discourse.

The networks are real like nature, narrated like discourse, and collective like society. THey are all things that resist segmentation.

### What does it mean to be modern?
There is something about the passage of time?
1. It designates a break in the regular passage of time
2. It designates a combat in which there are victors and vanquished.

The modern designates two sets of practices:
The first set creates mixtures (translations) between  types of beings. The second purifies two distinct zones, the human and the nonhuman.

Modernity involves thinking of translation and purification separately. If we realize that these are not possible to separate, then we have never been modern.

But the more we stop ourselves from creating hybrids, the more interesting they become.

## Constitution
Modernity is about humanism. But it is really about conjoining god, man, and nonhuman, and then the spreading of them apart.

There is something about constitutions, which define the separation between types of things? In politics we have political constitutions. What about in science? They separate out nature

Basically, politics separates out people pretending there is nothing else. Science separates out nonhumans pretending there is no political power or hybrids. But there is also the third aspect - the hybrids? Anthropology sometimes discusses hybrids. It is in a sense Latour's own self proclaimed job.

The constitution of hybrids is about defining humans and nonhuamns, their properties and their relations, and their abilities.

For Instance, the politician Hobbes and the scientist Boyle both had scientific and political theories. They did not draw the line we draw now between them.

That is, Hobbes and Boyle combine science and politics, and others draw a distinction again (The Royal Society)

But how does science spread? If we decide that there is some truth in science, how do we see these as a universal truth? We do not, we see a network of humans and nonhumans where there is a stable, but not universal, understanding.

There is a way in which Boyle invents something called a "laboratory" where science can be done, and acts as if politics and hybrids do not exist.

The modern critique, then could turn to nature to destroy prejudices

But really the moderns are considering things together, which stops them from really thinking of them separately.

 In particular, since nonhuman hybrids don't really hve a place, they are really put together. For instance, Boyle tried to create a vaccuum pump to prove that there was not an invisible ether everywhere in society the way that Hobbes argued. This is a mix of discussion of laws of nature, god, and disputes between man.

 ## Revolution
 HOw should we think about the ozone hole or global warming? Clearly these are hybrids of natual and human factors. Where do we deal with such things?

 We must think of things in terms a nonmodern dimension, the multiplication of hybrids. 



## Old Notes
modernity - the birth of man, but we forget that there is a simultaneous birth of things, objects, beasts, and a lack of emphasis on god

we have the separation of human and nonhuman an between what happens above and wat happens below

we say there are differences but they interact so much that to call them differences and to act on their differences is to create  - “hybrids continue to multiply as an effect of this separate treatment”

There is something about what a hybrid is here that I am not totally sure about

“Constitution” = defines humans and nonhumans, their properties and their relationships, their abilities and their groupings

boyle and hobbes differ on how you can know something is the truth, with boyle saying that you can believe nonhumans more than humans about how something works because humans are unreliable

## John Lie NOtes
Latour’s phd in theology from Latour wines.

in the lab they’re constantly trying to construct the object of study through interoperation and instrumentation.

impact on sociology because you can bridge the divide  - we tend not to talk about technology or th unnatural world, but whenever we do we bring in a lot of different things together

— different argument from latour ——
fact v fairy. when you criticize someone else you attribute to that position a sort of fairy-like type of all of the attitudes you disagree with. you create a double standard for what can be empirically proven, but the other idea can be empirically proven. this is the source of conspiracy theory because you can hold onto some difference.


—
theory class should do a lot of different things, it should familiarize you with the cannon of what it means to know sociology


look at the book “changing places”

in 17th century there is a fundamental chasm between nature and society. our work of purification casts hobbes into a particular sphere where he was a particular hybrid

there is also some distinction between modern and premodern, and we live in modernity, and we create different sciences for modern and premodernn. now

there is a fundamental asymmetry in explanation of modern and premodern. in premodern things are separate and in modern things are the same

latour is critiquing our self understanding, and we have a systematic mismatch between what people thought they were doing and what actually happened.

we think of traditional society as living in a cyclical time and other times we think of our modern time is linear
really modern time is a creation of different conceptions of time

the crossroads latour sees is that the world is replete with these hybrids, whereas in our work of understanding hybrids we engage in the work of purification

in sociology the condition of possibility of doing possibility is that we fundamentally separate the biological and the social realm however we divide this realm of ‘humans’ into different spheres like economics, politics, and sociology. in anthropology you can study the whole thing, but anthropologists only care about the third world. but the world doenst align with these categories. so when you want to study our attitudes we creat e a subfield called social psychology


the big point is to give agency to nonhuman actors

there’s also an idea of symmetry that’s here. why do we look to separate categories and try rouse different explanatory schemes (fecund)
