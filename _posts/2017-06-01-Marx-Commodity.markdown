Capital Volume 1
A commodity is an external object, a thing with is qualities satisfies human need of whatever tkind.
Everything breaks down to quality and quantity
The physical body of a commodity is its use value
Exchange value APPPEARS as the means of quantifying use-values
Exchange value creates some kind of common element between two things
So use values are qualities and exchange values are quantities

LABOUR a use-value has value only because abstract human abour isobjectified or materlized in it = p.129 –
If thise were true lazy people would make more valuable things, so there is some agreed upon, standard, “human labour power” which are the same as any other –
Use value the, is the amount of labour socially necessary, or the labour-time socially necessary for its production.”

Truly then, exchange values are merely definite quantile of conegealed labour-time” p. 130

These things really only exist within the context of
What about the rarity of the thing


Dual Character of Labour –

It doesn’t matter what type of work is done within the social division of labour. Labour, s the creator of use-values, as usefl labour, is a condition of human existence which is indepnet of all forms of society = it is an eternal natural necessity which mediates the metabolism between man and nature and thereforme human life itself

Even if you’re doing different thigns or combinations of different things, you’re still producing labour power.
The value of a commiditry represents human labour pure and simple
There is complex and simple labour – and comple labour is worth a multiplied version of simple labour

As a result of the constant trading that takes place in society, we see things as exchange values and almost forget entirely about the use value.
In other words, p.148 argues that we need other commodities to understand the value of a single commodity, because we are more focused on exchange value than use value.
This exchange value is a purely social creation.
Money (backed by gold and silver) hides this relation, making it seem like there is a difference between $10 and 20 yards of linen = 1 coat p.150

## Abstract Labor
But here's the thing. 20 yards of linen = 1 coat is not a true relation of just *things*. It is a relation of abstract labor. How many hours did it take to produce one, and how many hours for the other? This is the *social* relation that sits underneath the commensuration of commodities.

And there is another distinction between Abstract  and Concrete labor. I believe the difference is this:
* concrete labor - the labor it actually requires to produce an actual good for an actual human being
* abstract labor - a unit of labor time that makes concrete labor commensurable
And these two things are supposed to be opposites

A third peculiarity - private labor and social labor (labor just for yourself or as part of the relationship of society)

These three relations make it very hard to say exactly what commodity A is in relation to commodity B, and that's kind of the point. THere must be a lot of work done to get to money and prices from these things.

# The Total or Expanded Form of value
If we take 20 yards of linen and compare it to everything else in the world we get a bunch of different values, and this totality of comparisons shows how abstract human labor is at the heart of all commodity relations.
This is an expanded relative Form

Then we consider all other commodities in their relation with linen and we get a kind of "particular equivalent form."

Finally, we consider a general value which take all commodities in relation to a single different kind of commodity. (this is pretty  much the money form of value, you just pick gold and there you go)

p.163
"[Money's] analysis brings out that it is a very strange thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties."
The mystery is that it turns the social characteristics of labor into the product of labor.
It turns social relations into relations between objects. And relations between objects are social relations!

THe rest of the chapter plays a little with the idea of workers exchanging based on labour-time with each other, and how other economists are so foolish for missing the connection between use-value and exchange-value, and the implications for labor and social relations that come up as  a result. s
