# Capital Volume 1
## Part 7, Chapter 25
## The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation

Access the reading [here](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm#S1).

### Section 1
The section starts off with this breakdown:

|   | Production  | Labor  |   
|---|---|---|
|Value   | Constant Capital (value of the means of production)  | Variable Capital (value of labor power)   |
|Material   |Means of Production  |Living Labor Power   |

The Value side is called the "Value Composition" and the Material side is called the "Technical Composition"

Marx also calls the value section the "organic composition" of capital.

If we add all of the capital invested in one branch, conduct the average, we know the total composition of capital in the branch. Do this again and we know the total composition of capital in a country. This chapter is about this - "total social capital of a country"


But as capital grows, we also growth in the amount invested in labor power, which can be thought of as the subsistence fund, and the labor market works just like any other market. But individuals who are paid must always be working for capital's expansion of itself, and only getting a part of that reinvestment. At the same time, the greater desire for capital means the greater desire for workers which means an increase of the proletariat..

But that's just it, these are proletariats - subsistencd workers - labouring poor - wage labourers -
>who turn their labour power into an increasing power of self-expansion of the growing capital, and even by doing so must eternise their dependent relation on their own product, as personified in the capitalists.

Even so, here the relation spreads to more people, but remains as easily endurable - things are not getting worse for the workers. In fact, they can buy more stuff because they are producing so much more.
>But just as little as better clothing, food, and treatment, and a larger peculium, do away with the exploitation of the slave, so little do they set aside that of the wage worker.  A rise in the price of labour, as a consequence of accumulation of capital, only means, in fact, that the length and weight of the golden chain the wage worker has already forged for himself, allow of a relaxation of the tension of it.

This quote means to say that even if things get better, work is sitll being stolen by capitalists. I still cant help to think about the work of the managers and inventors - are these workers? Or are only financiers capitalists? But what of the work of choosing what to build.

The takeaway from section 1 is that wages come only from the difference between unpaid labor and the additional paid labor necessary to reinvest to make more money. In Marx's terms:
>The correlation between accumulation of capital and rate of wages is nothing else than the correlation between the unpaid labour transformed into capital, and the additional paid labour necessary for the setting in motion of this additional capital.

### Section 2
So far we have not considered how changes in technology effect this system. As capital develops, production becomes more and more technology (dead labor) and less and less "variable capital" orliving labor. But you can still be using more living labor, you're just producing more commodities.

In organizing all of the labor together and continuing to build on technology, we see a massive increase in the "social productive power of labor."
>With the accumulation of capital, therefore, the specifically capitalistic mode of production develops, and with the capitalist mode of production the accumulation of capital. Both these economic factors bring about, in the compound ratio of the impulses they reciprocally give one another, that change in the technical composition of capital by which the variable constituent becomes always smaller and smaller as compared with the constant.

We then see concentration of wealth vary on two bases:
1. The degree of increase of social wealth (I am not totally sure what social wealth is - maybe the total production of commodities)
2. The number of capitalists in a particular market (or sphere of production)

>Accumulation, therefore, presents itself on the one hand as increasing concentration of the means of production, and of the command over labour; on the other, as repulsion of many individual capitals one from another.

But the repulsion is counteracted by attraction, as market forces play out and we get a proper centralization of wealth - accumulation and concentration...These  are essentially the market forces towards monopoly. Two things mediating this is availability of credit and the amount of competition. However, to produce wealth you need a greater amount of starting wealth - i.e. a greater amount of centralization (I actually think this is not correct and maybe maybe a key point where things break down. There is definitely a high water mark, but as long as you can get over that hump, you can produce on your own - but this only works with state regulation curtailing monopoly). There is clearly more to think about here with respect to the difference between centralization and accumulation.

### Section 3
This section delves more deeply into the effect the accumulation of capital has on labor. He's doing a lot of relative calculations of "variable" and "constant" capital, but you can't really compare them 1:1 right? Constant capital can be all sorts of stuff...This is why we read this article about all of the Mechanical Turk Workers, whose work is only made possible because of the constant capital available to them. I'm not saying Marx is wrong, just that the argument seems more complex than Marx is making it out to be in section 3.

However, given this is right, then Marx continues:
>The labouring population therefore produces, along with the accumulation of capital produced by it, the means by which it itself is made relatively superfluous, is turned into a relative surplus population; and it does this to an always increasing extent...It forms a disposable industrial reserve army, that belongs to capital quite as absolutely as if the latter had bred it at its own cost.

But for endless growth to occur, you need to be able to call on individuals to work in one sector without harming another sector. To keep this reserve in tact, other workers are overworked.
> Relative surplus population is therefore the pivot upon which the law of demand and supply of labour works. It confines the field of action of this law within the limits absolutely convenient to the activity of exploitation and to the domination of capital.

 ### Section 4
The semi-demographic statements Marx makes in this chapter about surplus population and its connection to capital, I think, should be approached with skepticism. I'm not totally sure why I feel so skeptical. The argument is built on accepted arguments about supply and demand in the labor market generally, as well as principles that were developed in earlier sections.  

Marx argues that population increase creates states where we have not enough labor, and more than we know what to do with.
> That the natural increase of the number of labourers does not satisfy the requirements of the accumulation of capital, and yet all the time is in excess of them, is a contradiction inherent to the movement of capital itself.

Another idea here is that the work is so difficult it requires rapid renewal of laborers, that is, work tires people out to such an extent that they (increasingly?) cannot keep up with production once they get to a certain age.

This is the first of three forms of relative surplus population, called floating.

The second is called "latent" relative surplus population. This is the flow of individuals from certain sectors, mostly from agriculture to manufacturing. It is latent either because it already exists and is simply the movement of working people, or because the flow is some expected amount of change. This flow and movement is created as a result of industrialization.

There is also the stagnant form, those who are irregularly employed. This is essentially "disposable labour power"

Here we have the three parts of the industrial reserve army...
>The greater the social wealth, the functioning capital, the extent and energy of its growth, and, therefore, also the absolute mass of the proletariat and the productiveness of its labour, the greater is the industrial reserve army...But the greater this reserve army in proportion to the active labour army, the greater is the mass of a consolidated surplus population, whose misery is in inverse ratio to its torment of labour. The more extensive, finally, the lazarus layers of the working class, and the industrial reserve army, the greater is official pauperism. This is the absolute general law of capitalist accumulation. Like all other laws it is modified in its working by many circumstances, the analysis of which does not concern us here.

Maybe the skepticism I feel here is in relation to the rise of the service sector. Marx is seeing all of these people being pushed out of certain jobs and at the whim of capital, but there is also a growing movement to simply get other people to do things for you that you would have done for yourself. Moving functions out of the home turns them into commodities and works against these effects.

Marx goes on for a while at the end of this section, and mentions the conditions of the worker with respect to alienation which is worth including here.

>within the capitalist system all methods for raising the social productiveness of labour are brought about at the cost of the individual labourer; all means for the development of production transform themselves into means of domination over, and exploitation of, the producers; they mutilate the labourer into a fragment of a man, degrade him to the level of an appendage of a machine, destroy every remnant of charm in his work and turn it into a hated toil; they estrange from him the intellectual potentialities of the labour process in the same proportion as science is incorporated in it as an independent power; they distort the conditions under which he works, subject him during the labour process to a despotism the more hateful for its meanness; they transform his life-time into working-time, and drag his wife and child beneath the wheels of the Juggernaut of capital. But all methods for the production of surplus-value are at the same time methods of accumulation; and every extension of accumulation becomes again a means for the development of those methods. It follows therefore that in proportion as capital accumulates, the lot of the labourer, be his payment high or low, must grow worse.

The final section of this chapter focuses on a number of illustrations in different countries. I will come back to it if I have time...
