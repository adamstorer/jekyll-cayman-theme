## On the Reproduction of the Conditions of Production
Society must reproduce the conditions of production to survive.

What is the reproduction of the conditions of production?

Assuming a social formation arises from a dominant mode of production. Every social formation must reproduce
1. The Productive Forces
2. The Existing Relations of Production

### Reproduction of the Means of Production.

This cannot be thought of at the level of the firm, we must consider the economy as a whole.
>What happens at the level of the firm is an effect,
which only gives an idea of the necessity of reproduction,
but absolutely fails to allow its conditions and mechanisms
to be thought. p.129

For instance, firms must reproduce relations with one another.

### Reproduction of Labour Power

We must reproduce the productive forces. This means paying wages. The minimum necessary is a historical minimum based on what we think is necessary to live at any one time.

We must also reproduce some competence. We learn competence at school, and we also learn to follow rules of good behavior. That is, a reproduction of submission to the ruling ideology (and the ability to manipulate the ruling ideology).

>it is in the forms and under the forms of ideological subjection that
provision is made for the reproduction of the skills of labour
power. 133

But this means there is ideology.

What about the relations of production? In order to answer this question, we have to make sense of the following: what is society?

### Infrastructure and Superstructure

Marx believes in a social whole, in which society takes place at levels or instances. There is
1. Infrastructure - the unity of productive forces and relations of production and
2. Superstructure - Which has two levels
2a. Politico-Legal Superstructure
2b. Ideology (religion, ethics, ideologies)

This allows us to make sense of how effective each aspect is.
The metaphor suggests that the upper floor rests on the base.

The floors of the structure (the superstructure) are determined by the base, and they are determinant in their own ways only insofar as there is a base.

So how can there be determination of the superstructure? The common argument is:
1. There is relative autonomy between superstructure and base.
2. There is a reciprocal action of the superstructure on the base.

IT reveals that determination is crucial.

>it reveals that it is the base which
in the last instance determines the whole edifice ; and that,
as a consequence, it obliges us to pose the theoretical problem
of the types of 'derivatory' effectivity peculiar to the
superstructure, i.e. it obliges us to think what the Marxist
tradition calls conjointly the relative autonomy of the superstructure
and the reciprocal action of the superstructure on
the base p. 136

But maybe superstructure plays important roles with respect to what we discussed above, the role of ideology in reproduction.

#### The Essentials of the Marxist Theory of the State
The state is a function of state power. We distinguish between the state power and the state apparatus. The apparatus survives revolutions. From the Eighteenth Brumaire, we can make sense of why this happens

>the Marxist classics have always
claimed that ( I) the State is the repressive State apparatus,
(2) State power and State apparatus must be distinguished,
(3) the objective of the class struggle concerns State power,
and in consequence the use of the State apparatus by the
classes (or alliance of classes or of fractions of classes)
holding State power as a function of their class objectives,
and (4) the proletariat must seize State power in order to
destroy the existing bourgeois State apparatus and, in a
first phase, replace it with a quite different, proletarian,
State apparatus, then in later phases set in motion a radical
process, that of the destruction of the State (the end of
State power, the end of every State apparatus). p.141

#### State Ideological Apparatuses

We need something else though. We need to distinguish not only between state power and state apparatus, but also ideological state appartuses.

What are ideological state apparatuses? As opposed to repressive state apparatus, ideological state apparatuses deal with functionings of the state that are not immediately involved in repression. For instance, the state has ideological leanings and force with respect to schools, family, legal, political parties, trade unions, communications, and culture.

While there is one repressive state apparatus, the police, there are many ideological state apparatuses. ISAs can be part of the private domain. Why is the state private?

>But
someone is bound to question the second, asking me by what
right I regard as Ideological State Apparatuses, institutions
which for the most part do not possess public status, but
are quite simply private institutions. As a conscious
Marxist, Gramsci already forestalled this objection in one
sentence. The distinction between the public and the
private is a distinction internal to bourgeois law, and valid
in the (subordinate) domains in which bourgeois law
exercises its 'authority'. The domain of the State escapes it
because the latter is 'above the law' : the State, which is the
State of the ruling class, is neither public nor private ; on
the contrary, it is the precondition for any distinction between
public and private. The same thing can be said from
the starting-point of our State Ideological Apparatuses. p.144

SInce these things function, in other words, to reproduce ruling class ideology, they are part of the state?

Repressive State Apparatuses use physical repression mainly, all others use ideology. Each uses a little of the other.

>Thus Schools and Churches use suitable
methods of punishment, expulsion, selection, etc., to 'discipline'
not only their shepherds, but also their flocks. The
same is true of the Family . . . . The same is true of the
cultural IS Apparatus (censorship, among other things),
etc. p. 145

(The Problem of course, is trying to understand how much of this functioning is happening)

But a class, to stay in power, must have power over the Ideological State Apparatuses. This is how it produces consent, hegemony.

>This last comment puts us in a position to understand
that the Ideological State Apparatuses may be not only the
stake, but also the site of class struggle, and often of bitter
forms of class struggle. The class (or class alliance) in
power cannot lay down the law in the ISAs as easily as it
can in the (repressive) State apparatus, not only because
the former ruling classes are able to retain strong positions
there for a long time, but also because the resistance of
the exploited classes is able to find means and occasions
to express itself there, either by the utilization of their
contradictions, or by conquering combat positions in them
in struggle p.147

So, what is the role of the ISAs? To waht do these things correspond?

## On the Reproduction of the Relations of production
How is the reproduction of the relations of production secured? Ideological superstructure, in particular ISAs.

How can we make this argument:
1. All State Apparatuses function both by repression and ideology.
2. RSA's concstitue an organized whole whose different parts are centralized beneatha commanding unity. ISAs are multiple, distinct, and autonomous.
3. The unity of the ISAs is secured in contradictory forms, by the ruling ideology, the ideology of the ruling class.

RSAs secure by force what is necessary for ISAs to create consent.

But why are ISAs diverse or contradictory? We have seen a growth in ISAs. There used to be just the church really. Reformation was focused just on this. Now it is really the educational ideological appartus.

>I believe that the
ideological State apparatus which has been installed in the
dominant position in mature capitalist social formations as a
result of a violent political and ideological class struggle
against the old dominant ideological State apparatus, is the
educational ideological apparatus. p. 152

Why is the educational apparatus dominant?
1. All aparatuses contribute to teh relations of production.
2. They go about it in the way proper to it.
3. The ISAs are all dominated by a single one.
4. It is the school.
That is because

>It takes children from every class at infant-school age,and
then for years, the years in which the child is inost 'vulnerable',
squeezed between the family State apparatus and the
educational State apparatus, it drums into them, whether
it uses new or old methods, a certain amount of 'know-how'
wrapped in the ruling ideology (French, arithmetic, natural
history, the sciences, literature) or simply the ruling
ideology in its pure state (ethics, civic instruction, philosophy) p. 155

We all learn our roles. I am reminded of Donald Trump, the stable genius, here.

Education also has the ear of all children.

## On Ideology
For Marx, ideology is the system of the ideas and representations which dominate teh mind of a man or a social group. Why talk about ideology? Ideologies represent class positions, and have histories specific to them that cannot be made into one.

Ideology in general may speak to ideologies, but ideology has no history.

>In The German Ideology, this formulation appears in a
plainly positivist context. Ideology is conceived as a pure
illusion, a pure dream, i.e. as nothingness. All its reality
is external to it. Ideology is thus thought as an imaginary
construction whose status is exaGtly like the theoretical
status of the dream among writers before Freud. p. 157

For Marx, ideology is an imaginary assemblage of ideas. But Althusser argues that while ideology has no history, ideologies do.

### Ideology is a Represenation of the Imaginary Relationship of INdividuals to their Real Conditions of Existence.
1. Ideology represents the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence
>The essential
point is that on condition that we interpret the imaginary
transposition (and- inversion) of ideology we arrive at the
conclusion that in ideology 'men represent their reid
conditions of existence to themselves in an imaginary form'. p.163


But why do men need imaginary transpostion? Maybe people forged lies to help people belive. Maybe also in the conditions of production . For Althusser it is because men must amke sense of their relation to the conditions of existence which they can only do in their imagination.

>all ideology represents in its necessarily imaginary distortion not the existing
relations of production (and the other relations that derive
from them), but above all the (imaginary) relationship of
individuals to the relations of production and the relations
that derive from them. What is represented in ideology is
therefore not the system of the real relations which govern
the existence of individuals, but the imaginary relation of
those individuals to the real relations in which they live p.165

2. Ideology has a material existence.
Ideology is a representation of the real world, it is based on reality, it is not simply an idea.
>I shall therefore say that, where only a single subject
(such and such an individual) is concerned, the existence
of the ideas of his belief is material in that his ideas are his
material actions inserted into material practices governed hy
material rituals which are themselves defined hy the material
ideological apparatus from which derive the ideas of that
subject. p.169

## Ideology Interpellates Individuals As Subjects
>This thesis is simply a matter of making my last proposition
explicit : there is no ideology except by the subj ect and for
subjects. Meaning, there is no ideology except for concrete
subjects, and this destination for ideology is only made
possible by the subject : meaning, by the category of the
subject and its functioning

Althusser really had me, but in the discussion of ideology I think he falls off a bit. The subject/individual distinction seems pointless, and numerous other questions are given short shrift.

For Althusser about idelogy:
1. The interpellation of individuals as subjections;
2. Their subjection to the Subject (god, or whatever)
3. The mutual recognition of subjects and Subject, the subjects'' recoginition of each other, and finally the subject's recognition of himself.
4. The absolute guarantee that everything really is so, and that on condition that the subjects recognize what they are and behave accordingly, everything will be all right.

>But the vast majority of (good) subjects
work all right 'all by themselves', i.e. by ideology (whose
concrete forms are realized in the Ideological State Apparatuses).
They are inserted into practices governed by the
rituals of the I SAs. They 'recognize' the existing state of
affairs (das Bestehentie), that 'it really is true that it is so
and not otherwise', and that they must be obedient to God,
to their conscience, to the priest, to de Gaulle, to the boss,
to the engineer, that thou shalt 'love thy neighbour as
thyself', etc. Their concrete, material behaviour is simply
the inscription in life of the admirable words of the prayer :
'Amen - So be it', p.181


>if the
reproduction of the relations of production is to be assured,
even in the processes of production and circulation, every
day, in the 'consciousness', i.e. in the attitudes of the
individ􁁾al-subjects occupying the posts which the sociotechnical
division of labour assigns to them in production,
exploitation, repression, ideologization, scientific practice,
etc. Indeed, what is really in question in this mechanism
of the mirror recognition of the Subject and of the individuals
interpellated as subjects, and of the guarantee given
by the Subject to the subjects if they freely accept their
subjection to the Subject's 'commandments' ? p.182
