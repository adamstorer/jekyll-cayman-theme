Abstract: "Institutions are linkage mechanisms that bridge across three kinds of
 social divides - they link micro systems of social interaction to meso (and
 macro) levels of organization, they connect the symbolic with the material, and
 the agentic with the structural. Two key analytic principles are identified for
 empirical research, relationality and duality. These are linked to new research
 strategies for the study of institutions that draw on network analytic techniques.
 Two hypotheses are suggested. (1) Institutional resilience is directly correlated to
 the overall degree of structural linkages that bridge across domains of level,
 meaning, and agency. (2) Institutional change is related to over-bridging, defined
 as the sustained juxtaposition of multiple styles within the same institutional site.
 Case examples are used to test these contentions. Institutional stability is
 examined in the case of Indian caste systems and American academic science.
 Institutional change is explored in the case of the rise of the early Christian
 church and in the origins of rock and roll music"

We want to understand how cultural meaning is produced by networks. There are two centrl principles here:  Relationality and Duality

Two claims about social institutions:
1. Stickiness of institutions  (how enduring they are) is related to their capcity to bridge divides.
2. Undoing of insititutional stability may be dependendent upon the sustained juxtaposition of multiple styles within the same institutional site.

> In a sense then, institutional stability derives from bridging while instability is the result of over-bridging. p.488

# Defining institutions

Is it conventions or constellations of activities?  They are:
1. Fundamental, pervasive, and varied features of social existence.
2. Any notion of institution requires a larger theory of sicety.

So what are institutions as part of a theory of action?

Institutions are different types of interlocking networks. But waht is the social phenomenon of a network? White describes networks as roles of generalized identities.

>Identities are triggered out of events - which is to say, relational situations that emrge from the flow of social events, witching from one network situation into another, that produce a need for control over uncertainty and thus a control over situated actions and fellow identities.  p.6

People move from one situation to another with different network domains.

Institutional life is organized around cultural networks, relational structures that link meanings togehter into various configurations.

Here it is the relations that matter, rather than the individauls.

## Duality and Institutional ORders

Structural duality - a relationship that inheres within and between two classes of social phenomena such that the structural ordering of one is constituted by and through the structural ordering of another.

## Three Sites of Institutional Analysis
1. Duality of styles and institutions - do institutions exist without the agents that act through it? This is the duality of institutions and styles.
Styles - fundalmental specifications of how indiviudal agents live their lives throught an ongoing process fo combining understandings of situations with sets of practices arrayed across lives embedded within social networks.

Styles are not idiosyncratic - it is through institutions that styles come to be enacted.
Institutions are partly a pattern of socio-cultural organization.
>IN this article, our argument is that style can best be understood when viewed against the background of an institution that arrays and disciplins actors' perceptions of the socail organization of values in which they are embedded. The actors are constructing this organization through and thus because of the instuationt that we can read from their behavior.  p.9


2. The duality of the social and the cultural

HOw are meaninful experiences linked to physical experience and social structures? Meaning is part of how agents navigate life. But social structures draw on a set of stories and institutional arragnements.

Values too are drawn out form a network - and Parsons makes the mistake of trying to strip values out of styles tied to sociali organization. In institutions, values come as kind of ready made sets. Networks show how values are packaged together.

3. Dualities among nested levels of social life.

When an institution can bridge across levels of social organization, it becomes more enduring and robust.

## Two Examples

Two institutions are Caste and Science. In one, chang eis impossible but in the other it is not supposed to be.

But how do networks work together to make sense of what purity is? In villages with cate, purity is extremely explicit. Raning of caste are obvious, and through kinship caste cuts across various aspects of social life. But is a caste moves to a new village they can take on a new value - there is some mobility.

There is also a pecking order fro scientific specialties. Purity plays some role in this order. IF one moved university, one would find a different pecking order and notion of hierarchy in the different place.

Change ofstyle within a network si difficult, and must be done with messes and fights and emerges out of chaos. If there is one style within a network, it would be hard to change. If there were multiple styles readily avilable, maybe they coudl change.

Different styles, for instance of religion, if they overlay and repel each other, can lead the way for radical reimaginings of change.

## White Pop and black pop into rock n roll

rock n roll had a fresh package of values which infiltrated an emergeingpopulation - teens, and became recognized. This was possible because there was a new generation of networked connections (children of baby boomers) and there was also many forms of music (black popular, gospel, blues/jazz and many white forms as well) which overlapped. When white borrowed black it kind of upended things. Overlays of different tyles allowed for something new- Elvis. It wasn't something new but a new combination.
