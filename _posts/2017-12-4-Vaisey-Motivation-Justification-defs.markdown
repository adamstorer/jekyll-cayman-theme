Abstract: "This article presents a new model of culture in action. Although most sociologists who study culture emphasize its role in post hoc sense making, sociologists of religion and social psychologists tend to focus on the role beliefs play in motivation. The dual-process model integrates justificatory and motivational approaches by distinguishing between “discursive” and “practical” modes of culture and cognition. The author uses panel data from the National Study of Youth and Religion to illustrate the model’s usefulness. Consistent with its predictions, he finds that though respondents cannot articulate clear principles of moral judgment, their choice from a list of moral-cultural scripts strongly predicts later behavior."

> This article presents a new model of culture in action. Although most sociologists who study culture emphasize its role in post hoc sense making, sociologists of religion and social psychologists tend to focus on the role beliefs play in motivation. The dual-process model integrates justificatory and motivational approaches by distinguishing between “discursive” and “practical” modes of culture and cognition. The author uses panel data from the National Study of Youth and Religion to illustrate the model’s usefulness. Consistent with its predictions, he finds that though respondents cannot articulate clear principles of moral judgment, their choice from a list of moral-cultural scripts strongly predicts later behavior.

The central question is what role do cultural meanings play in people's behavior?
Some cultural understandings are tools that people use to solve everday problems. Some argue that meanings or values play a motivational role in shaping behavior. HOweverthis is falling apart. So how do you use culture as a social and psychological justification and as a motivation for action?

## Motvation/Justification

The idea that people were motivated by values used to exist but ahs been under criticism. But people think all sorts of different things.

Some description of what motivates people or how they act in Swidler.

>From this, she concluded that what survive and causally
matter are not subjectively internalized cultural meanings but “strategies
of action”—the practical styles and skills that actors bring to bear on the
problems of everyday life. p.1678

Vaisey argues that if culture is something people use, it cannot be that cultural understandings or beliefs motivate action. This is a BS dichotomy.

### Tool Kit Theories Unstated Premises

Here is how the justification process looks:
1. People generally pursue consistent lines of action.
2. When asked about this action, they give contradictory accounts.
3. Therefore, the accounts cannot really be motivating
4. The true springs of action must be outside of subjectivity.


Here is how toolkit theory works:
1. People are in situational contexts and control departures of the pattern.
2. Institutions both large and small seem to be what drive action, while culture's role is limited either to imposing constraints or making sense of one's behaviors after teh fact.

>Swidler, the clearest theorist on this point, assumes that if cultural meanings
were in fact motivational, they would have to be grounded in articulable,
rulelike cognitive structures. Though she rarely asserts this directly,
she continually argues against the notion that “cultural meanings operate
. . . as logical structures that integrate means and ends” (2001, p. 187;
emphasis added) p.1680

In other words, the onlyother option is some sort of cultural meaning structure that is propositional, articulated, and logically complicated.

The contradictory cultural schemas people internalize cannot be motiational, because people would be motivated in different directions.

So if people do things differently than their justifications would permit, how do we make sense of this? One way is to take a congitive turn: there is two levels of consciousness, deliberative and automatic.

## The Divided Self
Giddens - Goffman has no motivation. Motivation is unconscious and grounded in a need for ontological security, a need for a stable wrold.
Bourdieu - There is power in UNCNONSCIOUS dispositions. Tastes come from an unconscious tendency to reproduce class position.

For Giddens there is some need for general meaning making, for Bourdieu you act as a reproduction of your social position.

In Cog.Sci there is a dual-process theory, where there is some conscious and some unconscious.

>In sum, while arguing contra earlier anthropologists (e.g., Geertz 1973)
that cultural schemas are not perfectly shared or perfectly internalized by
all members of a given society, cognitive anthropology has certainly not
rejected the idea of “culture as values that suffuse other aspects of belief,
intention, and collective life [for one that sees] culture as complex, rulelike
structures that can be put to strategic use” (DiMaggio 1997, pp. 264–
65). In fact, there is a robust notion of motivation implicit in the schema
concept itself, since schemas automatically generate different evaluative
and behavioral responses according to the interaction of the neural connections
and the nature of the inputs. p.1686-7

So:
1. Actors are driven primarily by deeply internalized schematic processes
2. Yet they are also capable of deliberation and justification when required by the demands of social interaction.

This model seems OK to me. I think this paper is worth coming back to again as I think about how to frame my research.
