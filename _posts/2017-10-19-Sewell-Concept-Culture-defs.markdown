defs_used:

    Define culture as learned behavior?: The whole body of practices, beliefs, institutions, customs, habits, and myths built up by homans and passed from generation to generation. This conceptualization is quite broad.
    Define culture as a part of differentiated institutions (social vs economic vs cultural)?: Social formations are composed of clusters of institutions devoted to specialized activities. There is a cultural sphere, an economic, and a social one. Culture is devoted to theproduction, circulation, and use of meanings. These can be broken down into art, fashion, literature, media, etc.
    Define culture as creativity/agency: This is a realm of creativity that escapes from the otherwise pervasive determination of social action by economic or social constructions. Culture is agency in the agency/structure debate.
    Define culture as a system of symbols and meanings: This is the Geertz view of things. This is the true parsonian Cultural System. That is, culture is a system of symbols and meanings that are somewhat abstract, contrasted with the social system (norms and institutions) and the personality system (individual motivations). One must then abstract the meaningful aspect of human action out from the flow of concrete interactions. 
    Define culture as practice: This is the big one. That is to say, culture does not necessarily have some logical uniform system within a society. It is the ways that people go about doing things. This is a performative conception of culture where you view people's actual actions as manifestions of culture, such as a 'toolkit'. That is, it is not coherent, it is discrete practices that one can take up (in order to make meaning in the world)
    What are the two ways in which the cultural dimension of practice is autonomous from other dimensions of practice?: Culture has a different structuring principle. Even if the practice is completely determined by some other principle, individuals must make meaning from it, and the meaning making is made in writing or symbols. Second, meanings related to a practice are shaped by many different contexts. 
    What is the job of the cultural analyst?: To discern what the shapes and consistencies of local meanings actually are and to determine how, why, and to what extent they hang together.

Sewell is trying to understand what we mean by culture. The history of the term begins in anthropology with cultural analysis. Now sociologists see the study of culture as studying how we make meaning in our social life.

## What do we mean by culture?

Sewell defines multiple ways in which we make sense of culture, and focuses primarily on how culture is a category of social life. He defines a few ways:

<def>Define culture as learned behavior?: The whole body of practices, beliefs, institutions, customs, habits, and myths built up by homans and passed from generation to generation. This conceptualization is quite broad.</def>
<def>Define culture as a part of differentiated institutions (social vs economic vs cultural)?: Social formations are composed of clusters of institutions devoted to specialized activities. There is a cultural sphere, an economic, and a social one. Culture is devoted to theproduction, circulation, and use of meanings. These can be broken down into art, fashion, literature, media, etc.</def>
This conceptualization of culture is from the Parsonian era and has been seeming more meaningful to me as of late. This is the study of high brow and low brow culture, usually in the form of a social constructionist type argument. But this really focuses only on a certain range of meanings. NOt the meanings we make out of, say, a social system.
<def>Define culture as creativity/agency: This is a realm of creativity that escapes from the otherwise pervasive determination of social action by economic or social constructions. Culture is agency in the agency/structure debate.</def>
But creativity and agency exist in all spheres and it is very difficult to say when something is or is not cultural in this setting.
<def>Define culture as a system of symbols and meanings: This is the Geertz view of things. This is the true parsonian Cultural System. That is, culture is a system of symbols and meanings that are somewhat abstract, contrasted with the social system (norms and institutions) and the personality system (individual motivations). One must then abstract the meaningful aspect of human action out from the flow of concrete interactions. </def>
<def>Define culture as practice: This is the big one. That is to say, culture does not necessarily have some logical uniform system within a society. It is the ways that people go about doing things. This is a performative conception of culture where you view people's actual actions as manifestions of culture, such as a 'toolkit'. That is, it is not coherent, it is discrete practices that one can take up (in order to make meaning in the world)</def>

## Culture as System and Practice

The general problem with seeing things as a system is that when you go into foreign lands and try to extrapolate a system of meaning making, you usually oversimplify. Sewell argues that anthropologists who search for a high degree of systematicity find it, and that's the problem! They are focused on what they want, go out and get it, and miss the rest. Sewell calls this sampling on the dpeendent variable.

## The Autonomy of Culture

>Let me begin this task by stating some assumptions about practice. I
assume that human practice, in all social contexts or institutional
spheres, is structured simultaneously both by meanings and by other
aspects of the environment in which they occur-by, for example,
power relations or spatiality or resource distributions. Culture is neither
a particular kind of practice nor practice that takes place in a
particular social location. It is, rather, the semiotic dimension of human
social practice in general. I further assume that these dimensions
of practice mutually shape and constrain each other but also
that they are relatively autonomous from each other p.48

My question for Sewell is, can we bound this practice in any way?

There are two types of autonomy that Sewell talks about.
<def>What are the two ways in which the cultural dimension of practice is autonomous from other dimensions of practice?: Culture has a different structuring principle. Even if the practice is completely determined by some other principle, individuals must make meaning from it, and the meaning making is made in writing or symbols. Second, meanings related to a practice are shaped by many different contexts. </def>

The fact that all autonomy takes place in semiotic form means there must be some coherence, but Sewell calls this thin coherence. I think this means that things can be deconstructed quite easily since the logics are open and allow for change.

All I want to understand here is the distinct difference from Parsonian thought here.

>My main points may be summarized
as follows: culture, I have argued, should be understood as a
dialectic of system and practice, as a dimension of social life autonomous
from other such dimensions both in its logic and in its spatial
configuration, and as a system of symbols possessing a(real but
thin cohercnce) that is continually put at risk in practice and therefore
subject to transformation. Such a theorization, I maintain, makes it
possible to accept the cogency of recent critiques yet retain a workable
and powerful concept of culture that incorporates the achievements
of the cultural anthropology of the 1960s and 1970s. p.52

In other words, cultures are contradictory and loosely integrated systems of meaning making that are often contested and subject to constant change.

>It is no longer possible to assume that the world is divided up into
discrete "societies," each with its corresponding and well-integrated
"culture." I would argue forcefully for the value of the concept of
culture in its nonpluralizable sense, while the utility of the term as
pluralizable appears to me more open to legitimate question. Yet I
think that the latter concept of culture also gets at something we
need to retain: a sense of the particular shapes and consistencies
worlds of meaning in different places and times and a sense that in
spite of conflicts and resistance, these worlds of meaning somehow
hang together.

<def>What is the job of the cultural analyst?: To discern what the shapes and consistencies of local meanings actually are and to determine how, why, and to what extent they hang together.</def>
