Abstract: "The recent cultural turn in American sociology has inspired a number of more scientifically oriented scholars to study the meanings that are embedded within institutions, practices, and cultural artifacts. I focus here on research that (a) emphasizes institutional (rather than individual) meanings, (b) uses a structural approach to interpretation, and (c) employs formal algorithms or quantitative procedures for reducing the complexity of meanings to
simpler structural principles. I discuss two core methodological issuesthe assessment of similarities and differences between items in a cultural system and the process by which structure-preserving simplifications are found in the data. I also highlight the importance of two-mode analytic procedures and I review some of the perceived benefits and criticisms of this style of research."

Mohr takes on the question of meaning in cultural objects. This has a fairly long history in sociology. Some have tried to do some formal analysis of meaning.

>Thus, the meaningful character of social action
(and of institutional life more generally) has appeared as part of the broader
theoretical context which frames these research programs rather than as something
that is measured directly. p.347

But this is not necessarily the same as a study of meaning, as Griswold argued before. Griswold, however, only studies meaning through literature and not necessarily in the broader social world.
<def>Mohr's characterization of Griswold: As Wendy Griswold has persistently complained, most of the research continues to sidestep the problem of meaning analysis altogether. The distribution of genres has been mapped, elements of cultural production have been counted, levels of cultural knowledge have been measured, increases of organizational homogeneity have been demonstrated, but the meanings that are constitutive of these cultural phenomena have largely been left aside. Griswold has sought to develop methodological approaches that incorporate sociology s empirical rigor and sophisticated understanding of social structure while also taking the meanings embedded within literary and other cultural texts as a critical element of the analysis p.347</def>

So, how do we measure meaning outside of a literary text? There are three components that we can draw from to understand what's going on:
1. Participants
2. Performances
3. Audiences

Mohr uses three examples to make a point here:
>I have begun with these examples for several reasons. First, all three employ
structural methods for measuring meanings. In Tillys case, the meanings
concern collective actors sense of public rights and their conceptions about
the appropriate means for securing those rights. DiMaggio & Mullen study the
meanings of community and sets of emergent norms about how to symbolically
consecrate the social order. Mohr & Guerra-Pearson analyze organizational
interpretations of community social problems and contesting claims
about appropriate solutions to those problems. In each case, the relevant systems
of meanings are studied empirically through an analysis of the relationships
that actors impose on various primitive institutional elements (actors, actions
and objects of action). Finally, all of these studies make explicit linkages
between the systems of meanings that are investigated and the social structures
in which they are embedded. Indeed, the point of each project is to demonstrate
the ways in which enduring social institutions are explicitly constructed out of
a complex process of negotiation and contestation over cultural meanings.p.350

Each of these three examples uses a kind of structural interpretation, where meaning is connected to the analysis of the system of relations that link cultural objects.

<def>What are the core principles of structural analysis of cultural meaning?: (a) basic elements within a cultural system are identified, (b) the pattern of relations between these elements is recorded, (c) a structural organization is identified by applying a pattern-preserving set of reductive principles to the system of relations, and (d) the resulting structure (which now can be used as a representation for the meaning embedded in the cultural system) is reconnected to the institutional context that is being investigated</def>

But developing the basic elements is difficult and varies quite a bit depending on who you're talking to. The same problem shows up again in part b, identifying relations.

Mohr is quite concerned with how one might measure relations between different elements in order to proceed in some kind of cultural analysis.

## Measuring Relations
>Ideally, relations between the cultural elements
should be assessed by looking at how actors, organizations, or institutions
make practical use of the cultural distinctions being investigated.

<def>Mohr has three ways of measuring relations. What are they?: Similarities and differences among cultural items can be assessed according to (a) subjective judgements, (b) common attributes, (c) relations to others, and (d) structural-functional profiles.</def>

#### Subjective Similarity
How can we say things are of the same sort. We can ask people to judge the similarity of pairs, or pick the two out of three that are the most similar. Some people use pile sorting techniques.

#### Attribute Similarity
Make things similar based on the attributes that they share. For example, things that represent achievement.

#### Relational Similarity
What social relations link objects together? For example, there is the question of who stores what where, like is ketchup in the fridge or in the pantry, and thix effects how you relate ketchup to other things or what you might use as a substitute if it was missing. One may, for example, ask what is substitutable


#### Similarity of Structural Function
How do these objects fit in with some larger social narrative.
>To get at this kind of information it is necessary to record
who does what to whom, and in what sequence. p.356

## Finding Structure
Once you have the data, what is the process by which you should go about finding structure?
<def>How does one go about finding structure in meaning relations?: (a) multidimensional scaling and clustering, (b) network analysis, (c) Boolean algebra, and (d) sequence analysis.</def>

#### Multidemensional Scaling
>Simply stated, an MDS analysis reads in a square matrix
of similarities or differences (actually half of a square matrix is usually used
because the input data are often symmetrical) and produces a transformation of
the data that seeks to locate all of the objects in a common (two- or more dimensional)
space in such a way that the similarities in the input matrix are
transformed into Euclidean distances. An MDS space would thus represent a
series of objects in such a way that (generally speaking) if two items are similar
to one another (in the input matrix) then they are located near one another in
the space

#### Clustering
>clustering methods tend to connect items to clusters
that are deemed (by some criteria) to be most similar in a localized (or pairwise)
sense p.357

This method is quite similar to MDS.

#### Network Analysis
Lots of people use network analysis and you can sometimes use this for culture. THink of, for instance, the importance ofa structural role. If you were mapping out cultural meanings you might be able to find people with some kind of structural similarity.

#### Boolean Algebra
This is something like qualitative comparative analysis. You use some sort of set of cases ad group them according to their features and then find some irreducible finite system of connection.
>like the methods
discussed above, the usual goal of a Boolean analysis is to ascertain which features
of a set of cases have a causal relationship with some other feature (or
outcome) that is being explained. In this sense, QCA is similar to logistic regression
analysis, although as Ragin explains (1995), there are variety of reasons
why one might prefer using QCA, including the fact that it can be applied
with many fewer cases p.360

#### Sequence Analysis

Here you look for patterns of events in a sequence over time.


## Measuring the Duality of Social and Cultural Structures

The methods above do not show how social structures can produce meaning, and focus purely on the connection of cultural meanings can somehow be measured.
>In this section, I discuss several methods that can be employed to focus attention
on the duality that inheres between cultural and social structures. These
are the class of methods that are described as two-mode data analytic strategies
because they simultaneously order both columns and rows of a data matrix. p.361

#### Correspondence Analysis

Correspondence analysis also relates social structural elements to the culture domain. This is what BOurdieu does in distinction. I am not totally sure how correspondence analysis works.  

#### Lattice Analysis
These map rows and columns based on boolean set theory. I am not sure about any of these.

#### Hierarchical Classification Models

>This is an
iterative algorithm that accomplishes the same goal as a lattice analysis by
employing set theoretical principles to cluster items in the rows (objects) and
the columns (attributes) of a two-way two-mode binary matrix such that
equivalent items are classed together, the classes of objects are hierarchically
ordered, the classes of attributes are hierarchically ordered, and the two hierarchical
orders are related to one another. p. 363
