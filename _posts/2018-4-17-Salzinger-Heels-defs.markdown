Some work relies on malleable female young women, and people believe these young women are better workers.

HOwever, young women sometimes began to be more assertive, not behaving like "women" and managers turned to men. But still they paint women as malleable and men as impatient.

>Thus, these labor market shifts have produced a highly visi- ble disjuncture between public narratives about gender and work and managers' gendered shop-floor strategies. Individual manager's claims around the gendered nature of the "ideal" worker reference public framings but do not reproduce them. Instead the specific institutional functions and managerial subjectivities on each shop floor lead not only to particular sys- tems of production and labor control but also to specifically gendered versions of these systems p. 5

The work is low-wage and low-investment.

WE see in one case a straightforward mirroring of the external narrative. Male supervisors direct sexualized young women. In HR they use what it means to be a "good woman" or "good man" to try and shape behavior. Women also use their sexuality and think about it in this same way - and they realize that this notion of sexuality is what they are opreating within.

As a low-level male worker, they see it as a place to get a grilfriend but can't get attention:
>"It's a good environment here," she says. "In the street they [men] mess with us, but here, we mess with them a little. We make fun of them and they get embarrassed." In the factory, to be male is to have the right to look, to be a super-vi- sor. Gender and class positions are discursively linked. Stand- ing facing the line, eyes trained on his work, the male line- worker does not count as a man. In the plant's central game, he is neither subject nor object. As a result, he has no location from which to act-either in his relation to the women in the plant or in relation to factory managers p.10

At a different company, Anarchomex, they draw on gendered notions but their labor practices differ. Managers are not really present on the shop floor, and have trouble finding female wokers. So men claim the floor as their own.

But there are also frameworks people can draw upon for paying people little money, and that framework is gendered.

>Stepping into the vacuum left by management, male workers determined to reestablish their masculinity assert it in this space. New, orange-smocked workers are greeted by male voices immediately upon entering the factory floor. "Carrots, carrots!" goes the chorus. But soon the women among the newcomers pick out a different call. "Carrot, come. Come here! Here's your rabbit!" Whistles and kissing sounds follow each woman as she walks past line after line to her new workstation. Within a cou- ple of days she is angling for the navy smock used by other workers, an escape from the heightened visibility of the bril- liant newcomer's uniform p.14

>stop. Sexuality-for both the young women and the young men in the plant-remains a primary entertainment, occupation, preoccupation; and in the game of flirtation, men act and women receive. Male workers leave their posts to flirt with prospective girlfriends. Women workers turn their backs on harness boards to chat with suit- ors. Men call out or visit, women smile and chat in response, either enthusiastically or with polite distance. But they ignore advances at their peril p.15
