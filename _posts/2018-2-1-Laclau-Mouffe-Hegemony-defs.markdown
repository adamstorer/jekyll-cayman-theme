# Introduction

The world exists in ways that Marx perhaps didn't predict.

>The guiding thread of our analysis has been the transformations in
the concept of hegemony, considered as a discursive surface and
fundamental nodal point of Marxist political theorization. Our principal
conclusion is that behind the concept of 'hegemony' lies hidden
something more than a type of political relation complementary to the
basic catego ries of Marxist theory . p.3

# Hegemony - Genealogy of a Concept

Hegemony alludes to a contingent intervention required by the crisis of collapse of what would have been normal historical development.
Hegemony is an absent totality

## Orthodox Response
Rosa Luxemburg argued that in Germany there was a lot of fragmentation around workers.
>This isolation and fragmentation
is not a contingent event: it is a structural effect of the capitalist state,
which is only overcome in a revolutionary atmosphere. ' p.9

So if Russia could only move forward because it was so backward ithad not fragrmented, what happens to the western world?

There are two distinct logics at play here, a logic of spontaneity and a logic of cecesisty.  This is wrong, I am moving quickly here because I don't want to spend too long on all of this bs.

I think this is where the notion of hegemony comes from:

>This crisis , which served as the background to all Marxist debates
fro m the turn of the century until the war, seems to have been
dominated by two basic moments : the new awareness of the opacity
of the s ocial , of the complexities and resistances of an increasingly
organized capitalism; and the fragmentation of the different positions
of social agents which, according to the classical paradigm ,
should have been united p.18

And basically as people move on, they are trying different tctics to make sense o fthings that don't seem to work. We have logics of appearance and contigency.

>The three areas of effects analysed above present a common
characteristic: the concrete is reduced to the abstract. Diverse subject
positions are reduced to manifestations of a single position; the
plurality of differences is either reduced or rejected as contingent; the
sense of the p resent is revealed through its location in an a priori
succession of s tages . It is precisely because the concrete is in this way
reduced to the abstract , that history , society and social agents have
for orthodoxy , an essence which operates as their principle oj unification .
And as this essence is not immediately visible, it is necessary to
distinguish between a Sl4rJace or appearance of society and an underlying
reality to which the ultimate sense of every concrete presence
must necessarily be referred , whatever the level of complexity in the
system of mediations . p21-22

On orthodoxy:
>As we have
seen , theory maintained that the growing disjuncture between final
objective and current political practices would be resolved at some
future moment , w hich operated as a coincidentia oppositorum . As this
practice of recomposition, however, could not be left entirely to the
future , a struggle had somehow to be waged in the present against
the tendencies towards fragmentation . But since this struggle
entailed forms of articulation which did not at that time spontaneously
result from the laws of capitalism, it was necessary to introduce a
social logic different from mechanical determinism - that is to say,
a space that would restore the autonomy of political initiative. p.25

But the authors argue that Marx was only speaking to the laws on their own, they were morphological in that sense.

## Revisionist Response

>The main point oj divergence was that, whereas
orthodoxy considered that the Jragmentation and division characteristic oj the
new stage d cap italism would be overcome through changes in the inJrastructure,
revisionism held that this was to be achieved through autonomous
political intervention . p.31

>to follow the logical lines of Bernstein's argument
, while eliminating the essentialist presuppositions (in this case,
the postulate of progress as a unifying tendency) which limit its
effects. Two conclusions immediately arise from this test. First,
democratic advances within the State cease to be cumulative and
begin to depend upon a relationship of forces that cannot be determined
a priori . The object of struggle is not simply punctual gains,
but forms of articulating forces that will allow these gains to be
consolidated . And these jonns are always reversible . In that fight , the
working class must struggle from where it really is: both within and
outside the State . But - and this is the second conclusion Bernstein's
very clearsightedness opens up a much more disquieting
possibility . If the worker is no longer just proletarian but also citizen,
consumer, and participant in a plurality of positions within the
country's cultural and ins titutional apparatus; if, moreover, this
ensemble of positions is no longer united by any ' law of progress'
(nor, of course, by the 'necessary laws' of orthodoxy) , then the
relations between them become an open articulation which offers no
a priori guarantee that it will adopt a given form . p.36

## REvolutionary Syndicalism Response

>Unlike Bernstein , he does not make the slightest
attemp t to replace orthodoxy's historical rationalism with an alternative
evolutionist view , and the possibility that a form of civilization
may disintegrate always remains open in his analysis . The
totality as a founding rational substratum has been dissolved, and
what now exists is melange. Under these circumstances , how can one
think the possibility of a process of recomposition? Sorel's answer
centres on social classes, which no longer play the role of structural
locations in an objective system , but are rather poles of reaggregation
that he calls 'blocs'. The possibility of unity in society is thus
referred to the will of certain groups to impose their conception of
economic organization p.38

# Hegemony: The Difficult Emergence of a New POlitical Logic

Hegemony comes from a void. It addresses a new dualism of differetn levels of structuration. So we get - inrastructure does not determine everyting because consciousness or will also intervens in history. s

Things are indeterminate and thus vague. lso, the dualism responds to the fact that there is no political logic. Thirdly, economic fragmentation prevents class kind of.

>In the writings of
Plekhanov and Axelrod , the term 'hegemony' was introduced to
describe the process whereby the impotence of the Russian bourgeoisie
to carry through its 'normal' struggle for political liberty
forced the working class to intervene decisively to achieve it p.49

>in the Russian case, since the dislocations exp
ressed them selves as positive conjunctures permitting the advance
o f the work ing class - a certain way of infiltrating itself in to
his tory - it became necessary to characterize the new type of
relationship between the working class and the alien tasks it had to
assume at a given moment. Tllis anomalous relation was called
' hegemony' . p.50

Hegemony means a tension between two things:
1. The hegemonized task an its natural class agents
2. The hegemonized task and the class hegemonizing it.

The first one is more important. Some others developed hegemony (Such as Lenin) but in so doing, they really only discussed the types of situations where hegemony takes place, rather than making sense of hegemony.

### Class Alliances Between Democray and Authoritarianism

>For Leninis m , hegemony
involves political leadership within a class alliance . The political
character of the hegemonic link is fundamental, implying as it does
that the terrain on which the link establishes i tself is different from
that on which the social agents are constituted p.55

Once we get to the democratic version of class struggle, we often get undemocratic leaders.
>Hence, to the extent that democratic
demands become more diverse and the terrain of mass struggle more
comple x , a vanguard that continues to identify with the 'objective
interests of the working class' must increasingly broaden the hiatus
between its own identity and that of the sectors it seeks to lead p. 56

>The condition
for the maintenance of working-class unity and identity on the
terrain of economist stagism - the only terrain capable of constituting
it as a ' universal class ' - was that the hegemonized tasks should
not transform the identity of the hegemonic class, but enter into a
merely external and factual relation with it. Moreover, the only way
of affirming the external character of this relation was to tighten the
bond between the hegemonized task and i ts ' natural' class agent p.57

IN DEMOCRACY
>Without hegemony,
socialist practice can focus onl y on the demands and interests of the
working class . But insofar as the dislocation of stages compels the
working class to act on a mass terrain , it must abandon its class ghetto
and trans form itself into the articulator of a multiplicity of antagonisms
and demands stretching beyond itself. P.58

The idea is that, if the workers want to be the ruling class then they have to operate on the terrain of the masses beyond the classes, in which they lose their meaning.
This means that
1. The identiify of classes is transformed by the hegemonic tasks they take on themselves
2. The field of hegemony ceases to involve a mazimization of effects based on a zero-sum game among the classes.
3. The field of politics can no long be a representation of interests.
4. Since identity is no longer constituted through the relations of production, it becomes a precarious articulation.


## Authoritarianism
>This last point is decisive: hegemonic tasks become increasingly
central to communist s trategy , as they are bound up with the very
conditions of development of the world capitalist system . For Lenin,
the w o rld economy is not a mere economic fact, but a political
realit y : it is an imperialist chain . p.60

## Gramsci

Two interpreations of Gramsci
1.  Gramsci is a theoretician who was helped by italy's backwardness. He made sense of uneven development.
2. A theoretician of revolution in the WEst. The strategies involved are those based on advanced civilizations and dense political and social relations.

But Gramsci is a leninist who said:
>The proletariat
can become the leading and the dominant class to the extent that it
succeeds in creating a system of alliances which allows it to mobilize
the majority of the working population against capitalism and the
bourgeois State. In Italy , in the real class relations which exist there,
this means to the extent that it succeeds in gaining the consent of the
broad peasant masses . p.66

>Intellectual and moral leadership constitu
tes , according to Gramsci , a higher synthesis , a 'collective wil l' ,
w hi ch , through ideolog y , becomes the organic cemen t unifying a
'historical bloc' . All these are new concepts having an effect 0 f
displacement with regard to the Leninist perspective: the relational
specificity of the hegemonic l ink is no longer concealed , but on the
contrary becomes entirely visible and theorized .

Ideology for Gramsi is an organic relational whole.

>For Gramsci, political subjects are not - strictly speaking
- classes , but complex ' collective wills'; simil arly, the ideo­
logical elements articulated by a hegemonic cl ass do not have a
necessary class belonging p.67

>This explains the
importance attributed by Gramsci to the 'national-popular' and to
the formulation of a concept such as ' integral State ' , in which the
dominant sector modifies its very nature and identity through the
practice of hegemony. For Gramsci a class does not take State power,
it becomes S tate


>For
Gramsci, even though the diverse social elements have a merely
relational identity - achieved through articulatory practices there
must always be a single unifying principle in every hegemonic
formation , and this can only be a fundamental clas s .

>Struggles derive
their meaning from their hegemonic articulation , and their progressive
character - from a socialist point of view - is not assured in
advance . History , therefore , is regarded not as an ascendant continuum
o f democratic reforms , but as a discontinuous series of hegemonic
formations or his,torical blocs . In the terms of a distinction we
drew earlier , Gramsci might share with Bernstein his 'revisionism ' ,
but certainly not h i s 'gradualism' . p71

HOw does hegemony relate to the economhy?
>The economic level , however , must satisfy three very precise
conditions in order to play this role of constituting the subjects of
hegemonic practices . Firstly, its laws of motion must be strictly
endogenous and exclude all indeterminacy resulting from political
or other external interventions - o therwise, the constitutive function
could not refer exclusively to the economy. Secondly, the unity
an d ho mo geneity of social agents , constituted at the economic level,
must result from the very laws of motion of this level (any fragmentation
and dispersion of positions requiring an instance of reco
mposition external to the economy is excluded) . Th irdly, the
position of these agents in the relations of production must endow
them with 'historical interests' , so that the presence of such agents at
other social levels - through mechanisms of ' representation' or
'articulation ' - must ultimately be explained on the basis of
economic interests . The latter are, therefore, not restricted to a
determinate social sphere , but are the anchorage for a globalizing
perspective on society . p.76

Of course this is not true. What do we get:
1..Unfixity is a condtion of social identity. Nothing is necessary linked to class identity, so everything is relational.
2. As a result, we don't get a strong link between socialism and social agents.
3. Shoul dwe put the logic of hegemony into question?


So what can we use hegemony for?

# Beyond the POsitivity of the Social: Antagonisms and Hegemony

What we really have now are fragments of a los unity. And we attempt to return to dialectics to say something about it.
They argue that articulation is part of the notion of hegemony, and they look at Althusser here.

>Yet,
Althusser lapses into the very defect he criticizes: there is an abstract
universal object, the 'econom y ' , which produces concrete effects
(determination in the last instance here and now) ; and there is
another equally abstract object (conditions of exis tence) whose
forms vary histori cally , but which are unified by the pre-established
essential role of assuring the reproduction of the economy; finally, as
the economy and its centrality are invariables of any possible social
arrangement , the possibility opens up of providing a difinition of
society . p.99

>We are here presented with a conception of social formation which
specifies certain objects of classical Marxist discourse - relations of
production, productive forces , etc . - and reconceptualizes the articulation
between those objects in terms of 'securing the conditions of
existence ' . We will attempt to prove: a) that the criterion for specifying
objects is illegitimate; b) that the conceptualization of the
relation among them in terms of mutually 'securing their conditions
of existence ' , does not p rovide any concept of articulation.p.102

## Articulation and Discourse

We have a few concpets - articulation - any practice establishing a relation among elements such that their identity is modified as a result of the articulatory practice.
The structured totality of the articulation is discourse, the different positions of the discourse we call moments. Elements  are not discursively articulated.

1. A discursive formation is not unified either in the logical coherence of its elements or int he a priori transcendental subject, or in the unity of an experience.
2. OUr analysis rejects the distinction between disursive and non-discursive practices. Every object is constitued as an object of discourse. Any distinction between types of social proactice is incorrect.

The basic points of discourse:
1. Every object is constituted as an object of discusrse has nothign to do with whether there is a world external to thought.
2. There is a mateerial character to discursive structure.  

>Let us move o n t o o u r second dimension. The impossibility o f an
ultimate fixity of meaning implies that there have to be partial
fixations - otherwise, the very flow of differences would be impossible
. E ven in order to differ, to subvert meaning, there has to be
a meaning . If the social does not manage to fix itself in the intelligible
and instituted forms of a society, the social only exists, however, as an
effort to construct that impossible object .p.112

To get meaning, therefore, we articulate:
>The practice oj articulation,
thertjore, consists in the construction qf nodal points which partially jix
meaning; and the partial character oj this jixation proceeds jrom the openness
oj the social, a result, in its turn , oj the constant ovetjlowing oj every
discourse by the i1'ifinitude oj the jield oj discursi vity p.113


>What the discourse of
'historical interests' does is to hegemonize certain demands . On this
point, Cu tler et al . are absolutely right: political practice constructs
the interes ts it represents. But if we observe closely , we will note
that, far from being consolidated , the separation between the
economic and the political is hereby eliminated. p.120

So either we have the separation between political and economic taking place on different planes or separation is the result of discursive pratices.

>The limit of the social must be given within the
social itself as something subverting it, destroying its ambition to
cons titute a full presence . Society never manages full y to be society,
because everything in it is penetrated by its limits , which prevent it
from constituting itself as an objective reality . We must now
consider the way in which this subversion is discursively p.127

I am finding the reconstitution of these ideas not particularly convincing.

How do we get something to be actually something? How do we reduce all other discursive forms?

## Hegemony

So the field of the emrgence of hegemony is articulated spaces, where elements are not yet moments. There is no possibility for hegemony if every identity is fixed.

>A fully successful system of differences , which
excluded any floating signifier, would not make possible any articulation;
the principle of repetition would dominate every practice
within this system and there would be nothing to hegemonize. It is
because hegemony supposes the incomplete and open character of
the social , that it can take place only in a field dominated by articulatory
practices p.134

So what are hegemonic articulations?
In order to speak of hegemony, one must go beyond the articulatory moment. It must take place through a confrontation with antagonistic articulatory practices.

>But, conversely , not every antagonism supposes
hegemonic practices . In the case of millennarianism, for example, we
have an antagonism in its most pure form, and yet there is no
hegemony because there is no articulation of floating elements:- the
distance between the two communities is something immediately
given and acquired from the beginning , and it does not suppose any
articulato ry construction. p. 136

1. Presents of antagnoistic forces
2. The instability of the frontiers which separate them.

>It does not emerge
from a s ingle point , but it is the result of an overdetermination of
circumstances ; and it reveals itself not only in a proliferation of
antagonisms but also in a generalized crisis of social identites . A
social and political space relatively unified through the instituting of
nodal p oints and the constitution of tendentially relational identities ,
is what Gramsci called a h istorical bloc. p. 136

WE get a better notion of war of positions.
1. There cannot be closure, the frontiers are internal to the social and the discourse cannot subsume the social formation.
2. The identity of the actors can also change.

>I t is clear from the a bo ve that we have moved away from two key
aspects of Gramsci's thought: (a) his insistence that hegemonic
subjects are necessarily constituted on the plane of the fundamental
classes ; and (b) his postulate that, with the excep tion of interregna
consti tuted by organic crises , every social formation s tructures itself
around a single hegemonic centre . As we pointed out earlier, these
are the two las t elements of essentialism remaining in Gramscian
thought. p.138

In this sense, hegemony is a type of political relation.

>no hegemonic logic can account
for the totality of the social and constitute its centre , for in that case a
new suture would have been produced and the very concept of
hegemony would have elim inated itself. The openness of the social
i s , thus , the precondition of every hegemonic practice. p. 142

There are some othe rproblems I'm not fully getting:
>i f an ensemble of empirically given agents (in
the case of a social formation) or an ensemble of discursive moments
(in the case of a hegemonic formation) are included in the totality
implied by the notion of formation , it is because through that totality
it is possible to distinguish them with regard to something external
to the latter. Thus , it is on the basis of its own limits that a formation
is shaped as a totality . If we pose the problem of the construction of
these lim i ts in the case of a hegemonic formation , we will have to
distinguish two levels: that related to the abstract conditions of
possibility of every ' formation' , and that related to the specific
difference which the logic of hegemony introduces into it. Let us
begin from the internal space of a formation as a relatively stable
system of differences . p.143
