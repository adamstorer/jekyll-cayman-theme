Abstract: "Recent work in cognitive psychology and social cognition bears heavily on concerns
of sociologists of culture. Cognitive research confirms views of culture as
fragmented; clarifies the roles of institutions and agency; and illuminates supraindividual
aspects of culture. Individuals experience culture as disparate bits of
information and as schematic structures that organize that information. Culture
carried by institutions, networks, and social movements diffuses, activates, and
selects among available schemata. Implications for the study of identity, collective
memory, social classification, and logics of action are developed."

Abstract
>Recent work in cognitive psychology and social cognition bears heavily on concerns
of sociologists of culture. Cognitive research confirms views of culture as
fragmented; clarifies the roles of institutions and agency; and illuminates supraindividual
aspects of culture. Individuals experience culture as disparate bits of

carried by institutions, networks, and social movements diffuses, activates, and
selects among available schemata. Implications for the study of identity, collective
memory, social classification, and logics of action are developed.

How do we let studies of culture culminate? We need to know wha the cognitive presuppositions are for the theory, and what the fundamental concepts are.

# Sociology and Psychology - Points of Convergence

## Complex View of Culture

Culture is not a seamless unitary web. A latent variable that wasnation specific.

Instead, recent work shows fragmentation across groups and inconsistent across its manifestations. A complex rule-like structure that constitutes resources and strategies.

If culture is inconsistent then we have to understand the "unit" and the relation among them.

## Psychology Complex Views
What are the mechanisms? Acquisition of skill sand capacities -

Complexity of memory shows how cultural complexity and fragmentation might work.

Psychological research focuses on cultural content in people's heads.

So what are the presuppositions of cultural sociologistS?

1. Coherence/Fragmentation
That is, fragmented toolkit/repertoire - a collection of stuff that is heterogeneous in content and function.

If culture is a latent variable then there is relative coherent, only a small number of shared symbols, rituals and practices.

If it is a grab bag, then we might expect less clustering .

In cogntive science - how people attribute accuracy  to information - it is part of an autoatic comprehension of that idea, and rejection is more effortful. OUr heads our full of things that we have no opinion to as related to truth value.

Cog Psych
>Instead, it directs the search for sources of stability and
consistency in our beliefs and representations, first, to schematic organization,
which makes some ideas or images more accessible than others; and, second,
to cues embedded in the physical and social environment p.267

In other words, there is consensus that we store every image or idea we come into contact with and believe as true.

*this feels like a stretch*

It also shows how we can participate in multiple cultural traditions, establishes how people maintain inconsistent action frames, and shows that socialization can be based as much on media and hearsay than direct contact.

## Institution and Agency
Culture both constrains and enables.  Embedded in language and everyday practices, culture constrains the imagination. But it also enables us to pursue ends.

But when? There are two possibilities

### Automatic Cognition - Implicit, unverbalized, rapid and automatic. people get routines stuck to them. they have expectations about those routines.

What is a schema - a knowledge structure that represents objects or events and provides assumptions about characteristics and relationships.

What we find is that schemas make the world intelligible, and people perceive infomration that is germane to the existing schema. But how does this fit with remembering everything?

### Deliberative Cognition - Explicit, Verbalized, Slow and Deliberate -
Attention - people can be made to deliberate
MOtivation - the swithc from automatic to deliberative cognition can be altered by the moral salience of an issue.
Schema Failure - when things don't work the way you thought they would.

## Culture as Supra-Individual
There is a collective level of culture that psychology can help with

Pluralistic Ignorance - People act with reference to shared representation of collective opinion that are empirically inaccurate.
Intergroup Polarization - Group level cultures
Schemata as Culture - not all schema are culture (object recogntion) - there might be some cultural constructionso fo eprsonhood that deals with schema stuff and personality

Maybe coherence comes from flows of available sources? Culture works through three forms:
1. Information distributed across persons.
2. Mental structures.
3. Culture as symbol systems

Potential other things we can study
Identities of Collective s- Chronically contested as groups vie to produce social representations capable of evoking schemata favorable to their ideal or material interests.

>Zerubavel, one of few sociologists to study classification from a cognitive
perspective, points out that the drive to partition a continuous world appears
to be a human universal, though the nature of the categories constructed may
vary significantly among groups (Zerubavel 1991, 1997, Douglas 1966). Rosch
(1978), whose work has dominated psychological thinking on the topic, proposes
(with much experimental support) that cognition is most efficient when
we chunk many separate features (bits of information) together by thinking
with a prototype (complete mental image) of an object. p.276

Still, we don't necessarily understand how schemas work or don't work, or how they are nested.
>Perhaps the highest priority for students of culture and cognition is to develop
models of thematization, by which I mean the ways in which diverse schemata
aggregate to more general and sociologically interesting constructs like thought
styles, stories, logics, paradigms, and ideologies. There are several candidates
for such models.

Atomistic Decoupling - Every day thought is randmoly invoked, loosely coupled schemas with little hierarchy.
Nested Hierarchy - Schemas are all super nested (This seems to be the sewell level)
Domain Specificity - Different schemas are stored differetnly
Identity Centrality - Emotional schema around the self may come into play more than others
Role Centrality - Since roles are situationally evoked, they may evoke situationl schema.

But how do we generalize from one thing to another
Feature Correspondence - A schema leads itself to analogy in so far as there are some shared features that create a correspondence.
Structure Mapping - There is maybe some domain-specificity where things move across domains in a way that makes sense.
Emotioanl Resonance - Hot schemata may be more generalizable
Polysemy - Some expressions may allow for analogical transfer.

I think this piece is fine but probably overstates the ability of schema to do useful stuff
