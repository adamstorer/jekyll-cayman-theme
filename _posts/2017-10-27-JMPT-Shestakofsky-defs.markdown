Are people coming for our jobs?

Research Question - under what conditions do software systems function autonomously - and when do they rely on the assistance of complementary human workers in real world settings?

Firms create and expand work forces to solve organizational problems

Substitution vs Complementarity are the two big ideas. Discontinutiy shows we are going to be difference and we're goign to be substituted. Continuity theorists believe the values will holdl.

Continiuity Theory - can they really figure this stuff out (machine learning skeptics)? For instance, self-driving cars use maps that are painstakingly labeled by human workers. THeses are usually at a very high level of abstraction. This is essentially big theory.


In yoru first example people are filling in for algorithms when the problem is too hard (at the time) for algorithms to do. Isn't this work substantively different from some other types of work? In other words, isn't it particularly precarious.

Individuals hire or deal with preserving trust - Here



I mean, isn't the point here that a huge company springs out of something that people used to be doing with a phone book? As technology expands individuals add technology to previous ways of working in dynamic ways, and this is more than automation, this is also ease of use or expansion of access.


I think you need to put your contribution a little earlier so we can see what's going on herE? And maybe more integration of your conclusions and the theoretical framing overall.

What is the point of this emotional labor? What if the anger fell on deaf ears?


Generalizability of the case beyond the startup field or the on demand economy?
