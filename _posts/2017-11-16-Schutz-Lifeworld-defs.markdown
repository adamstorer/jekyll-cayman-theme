World of daily life - the intersubjective world which is experienced and interpreted by ourselves and others.

Somehow we make sense of the complicated world, we focus on some features of the world and tuen out others. The world is something we are embedded within and act upon. But the world can resist, so it is something that we modify by our actions or that modifies our actions.

## Biographically Determined Situation

Man finds himself in a physical and socio-cltural environment
He is positioned in terms of physical space and time, his role within the system, and his moral and ideological position.
His own definition of the system is based on the "sedimentation of all of man's previous experiences, organized in the habitual possessions of his stock of knowledge"
This position includes the possibility for future action, which gives the individual some "purpose at hand"

## Stock of Knowledge
Man has a stock of knowledge that he uses to build a scheme of what's to come. Husserl speaks of the sedimentation of meaning.

The knowledge itself is not homogenous. There is knowledge about something and knowledge of acquaintance. There is true knowledge, vague knowledge, and then taken for granted but unreflexive knowledge, followed finally by complete ignorance.

Our practical interest at a moment determines where knowledge stands in this grouping.
>It is the particular problem we are concerned with that subdivides our stock of knowledge at hand into layers of different relevance for its solution, and thus establishes the borderlines of the various zones of our knowledge just mentioned, zones of distinctenss and vagueness, of clarity and obscurity, of precision and ambiguity. p.74

This is a pragmatist way of looking at knowledge.

In addition the stock of knowledge is in perpetual flux.

## The Character of Practical Knowledge
Knowledge is
1. Not Homogenous
2. Incoherent
3. Only partially clear
4. Not at all free from contradictions


<sum>Schutz is making an argument for how individuals make sense of the world around them. The world is a real place that we attempt to act upon and also that acts upon us. We make sense of the world by acting with respect to certain interests. These actions, interests are based on some set of knowledge that an individual has collected over time, to the point where previous experiences become habituated into how individuals use their stock of knowledge. The knowledge that individuals have is not homogenous, it is incoherent, unclear, and contradictory. We also may have relatively strong or weak grasps on knowledge.</sum>
