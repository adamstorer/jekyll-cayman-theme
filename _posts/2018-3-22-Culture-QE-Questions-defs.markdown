Ann wants a few questions that would make sense for the Culture QE based on some of the things we've discussed.

Potentially the discussion of the use in Schemas in talking about culture.


To what extent do boundaries play a useful role as part of culture.

We could also ask about the way in which national culture can be discussed without thinking of it as a monolith. That is, how do we disentangle Biernacki and Schalet's approaches, and how do we deal with the Harzing and Hofstede national culture (and maybe a Dobbin in there?)
