Wartime mobilization of workers got rid of gendered segregation, and then there was a period of resegregation. It defies the logic of profitability, because instead of keeping cheaper women we get more men.

>THroughout the history of capitalism, the incorporation of women into wage labor seemed to hold the promise of equality between the sexes...However, the economic and political forces that were expected to undermine the sexual division of labor have not done so. p.2

WE find women concentrate din poorly paid positions. Why the segregation? We should probalby look at specific industries. WE can ahve systematic comparative analysis in so doing. Different industries have different pattern of female employment.

## Theoretical Perspectives on Job SEgregation
Marxist-Feminists - Women's position in the family, and domestic life, drives division in the workforce. Unpaid housework minimizes the cost of reproducing labor power. If women are confined to low paying jobs ensures dependency on hasbands who will require unpaid housework.

But why are some jobs labeled male or female?

Labor market segregation - secondary workers make less money. We see that this secondary labor market is a division among workers.

But perhaps "as men" there is a sense in which men have a

That is, gender is a separate coexisting system which can not be reduced solely to capitalism. But we must think of the class AND gender interests of people.

There is an important starting point, because as an industry is establish, everything is based off of tradition. If women start out not working there, then eventually it seems right that they shouldn't be there.

In the electrical industry there was some women who did piece work mass production stuff. IN automotive management there was an assembly line and high wages.

During the war, women did men's jobs but were classified differently. This was not only on the employers side, but importantl on the union side as well. For auto workers they argued that women should get man's pay for men's work. In the electrical industry where there were more women to begin with, they questioned sex typing based on pay at all. Male workers were the protagonists, in that they wanted to protect men's payments.

When men came back, women were not allowed to stay at men's jobs.

# Chapter 2 Fordism and Feminization

In electrical work, production of lamps was made so simple that 8 out of 10 workers were low paid women.

That is, de-skilling also became synonymous with feminization in the electrical sector, but not in the manufacturing sector.

While there is sex egregation, what we see going into sex typing is pretty strange - based on real or imagined characteristics. Does one really need more "light" jobs than the other?

Sometimes in one plant a job would be feminine and in another it would be masculine.

Part of it is that in the autoworker setting a high wage reduced turnover and allowed a sped up production which reduced the need to include women. The decnetralized labor force of the electric industry pushed instead for lower wages.

# Great Depression and Triumph of Unionization
The great depression sent women away from work and put them back in the home.

But why in electrical manufacturing where production did not decrease during teh great depression? Corporate welfare was alla bout preferencing married men.

Also, the fluidity in electrical was larger so that men could go to women's jobs. But in auto it was clearer. So, women were kept on relatively more at the auto plants.

Really though, they should have been making more FEMALE jobs or less money! Women should really be doing this stuff.

During unionization theere were difficulties for women. For instance, clerical workers who were mostly womenw ere often left. Seniority also helped to stop things. But still married men were given preference.  And there was a separate seniority list for women, or by classifications.
