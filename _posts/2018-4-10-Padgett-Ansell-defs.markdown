Abstract: "We analyze the centralization of political parties and elite networks that underlay the birth of the Renaissance state in Florence. Class revolt and fiscal crisis were the ultimate causes of elite consolida- tion, but Medicean political control was produced by means of network disjunctures within the elite, which the Medici alone spanned. Cosimo de' Medici's multivocal identity as sphinx har- nessed the power available in these network holes and resolved the contradiction between judge and boss inherent in all organizations. Methodologically, we argue that to understand state formation one must penetrate beneath the veneer of formal institutions, groups, and goals down to the relational substrata of peoples' actual lives. Ambiguity and heterogeneity, not planning and self-interest, are the raw materials of which powerful states and persons are constructed."

Abstract
>We analyze the centralization of political parties and elite networks that underlay the birth of the Renaissance state in Florence. Class revolt and fiscal crisis were the ultimate causes of elite consolida- tion, but Medicean political control was produced by means of network disjunctures within the elite, which the Medici alone spanned. Cosimo de' Medici's multivocal identity as sphinx har- nessed the power available in these network holes and resolved the contradiction between judge and boss inherent in all organizations. Methodologically, we argue that to understand state formation one must penetrate beneath the veneer of formal institutions, groups, and goals down to the relational substrata of peoples' actual lives. Ambiguity and heterogeneity, not planning and self-interest, are the raw materials of which powerful states and persons are constructed.

Network disjunctures allowed for Medici to use different types of ties to gain social capital.

What is centralization? Founders emerge out of contending actors and impose rules for others' interaction.
Reproduction - Rules induce roles, whcih induce interests, which induce strategic exchanges, lock in patterns of collective action that dependent on the rules.
Control - others locked-in interactions generate a flow of collective behavior that just happens to serve one's interests.

And people msut believe they are self-interested in order to make sure reproduction is working.

We study the Medici in 1400 Italy, as one group fell and another group rose. The Medici took over due totheir place in elite networks:
>The Medici party was a heteroge- neous mixture of contradictory interests and crosscutting networks. In stark contrast to this fact, contemporaries perceived the Medici categori- cally as "heroes of the new men." The Medici's contradictory agglomera- tion exhibited great cohesion and capacity for sustained collective action. But what the Medici stood for is unclear to this day p. 1262

There is a style called "robust action" - Which is single actions which can be interpreted coherently from multiple perspectives simultaneously, so that single actions can be moves in many ames at once, and public and private motivations cannot be parsed.

>Robust action resolves the contradiction between judge and boss be- cause at the center there are no unequivocal self-interests. Cosimo, after all, "merely" responded graciously to the flow of requests. Because re- quests had to flow to him, others, not Cosimo himself, struggled to infer and then to serve Cosimo's inscrutable interests. Control was diffused throughout the structure of others' self-fashionings p. 1264

# Data

We have many differnt types
1. Kinship Relations
2. Economic Relations
3. Political Relations
4. Friendship Networks


Then there was also wealth, length in Florentine, neighborhood, and tax assessments .

They also defined elites, political elites using different critieria.


# Analysis

Remember, politics is not about self interested groups as much as it is about other stuff.

What precipitated the rise of the medici? It is not necessarily class or neighborhood.

>The main theme that comes through these attributional analyses is similarity, not difference. With the important exception of the absence of new men from the oligarch side, the Mediceans and oligarchs were mirror images of each other. The elite as a whole appears to have frac- tured in two, with no underlying social group basis. p. 1272

We see for the medici that parties and social groups were induced conjointly by underlying networks.The Medici basically was central, even if it had a lower degree. But also, there is something about the quality of the ties - the oligarchs had too many status equals and could not create action. The Medici's internal group had more cohesion.

The Medici had a network connecting more disparate people.  They had:
1. A Spoke structure with common ependence of partisans on the medici for access to other parts of the elite structure.
2. Segregation of attributes which inhibited counteralliances.
3. They married geographically distnat partners keeping them high status
4. The medici party was a swing vote

>Could it be that intraelite factional
struggles of the 14th century were so intense that, first following medieval
patterns, they polarized each neighborhood into competing patrician clusters
(cf. Barth 1959), but then, because of Ciompi escalation, they pulverized
the losing patrician side into structural isolates, which the Medici
much later exploited? If so, this would account in part for the increasing
rate of neighborhood exogamy, as the winners and, even more, the losers
had fewer compatible intraneighborhood marriage options to choose
from. Assuming social class endogamy, Florentine patrician marriages
would be forced outward because of neighborhood blockage, or structural
"holes," within. p.1291

There was also elite closure - oligarchical elites (different big families - began to become very insulary)
>In particular, we argue, elite marriage networks shifted permanently
during the period from 1385 to about 1420 from a quasi-feudal pattern
of parallel, intraneighborhood marriage hierarchies, which had incorporated
most patrician families, toward a citywide elitist pattern of crossneighborhood
marriage cycles, which co-opted "politically correct" patrician
families while structurally isolating patrician "class traitors" who
had collaborated with the Ciompi and artisan guilds. The folding of a
dense oligarchic core into itself (the rectangular set of blocks in fig. 2a)
and the segregation of patrician Medici supporters from this core (the
Guicciardini and Tornabuoni blocks in fig. 2a), in other words, were two
sides of the same elite reconsolidation process p.1293

The oligarchs also used marriage as a way to shun some families, creating class barriers that the medici could create. This cultural tool of SHUNNING THROUGH MARRIAGE has these large consequences.

THis took part in place because of status competitions which stemmed from an attitue in which wife-giving families wre seen as higher status than the men that married them's family.

When the medici were shunned and couldn't marry the top brass, they could either accept from lower social groups or expand their network. Expanding the network ended up giving them more connections.

There is a political battle going on, but the Medici, and the medici could provide patronage to groups they were married to from the outside that the other groups could not. More power.

So are there structural preconditions?

>robust action is not just a matter of behaving ambiguously.
Others are too shrewd not to see through behavioral facades down to
presumed self-interested motivations. To act credibly in a multivocal
fashion, one's attributed interests must themselves be multivocal.
Within the Medici party itself, the structural underpinnings for contradictory
attributions of "Medici self-interest" are clear. The Medici were
heroes of the new men not just because they inherited the historical legacy
of Salvestro d'Alamanno. They did sponsor a few San Giovanni families
of new men, quite unlike their oligarch opponents. And, after Giovanni  
spurned Rinaldo Albizzi's class alliance request, oligarchs heaped the
scornful opprobrium of that label on Medici heads in a polemical effort
to whip up patrician fury. At the same time, the Medici's deep patrician
roots were clear enough to those whom they married. One can easily
imagine Medicean patrician supporters knowingly winking at each other
on hearing the public charges of favoring the new men that swirled
around their in-laws.

Two groups - new men and patrician supporters - could both see actions as favorable for them. That is, as bankers and thus patrons, but also as families to increase prestige, and to amass power. It is hard to see which was at play when.


The interesting thing about this paper is that there is a connection between a few different things. There is kind of a set notion of cultural rules, and within this set people act in complex but logical, and multivocal ways. Patterns of rational-ish responses lead to social closure or bridging structural holes. In bridging, one can act in different ways and those different ways of acting can mean different things to different people.
