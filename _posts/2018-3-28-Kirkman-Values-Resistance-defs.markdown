Abstract: "Using a field survey of 461 self-managing work team members in four countries, we examined: (1) whether employee resistance to such teams mediated the relation- ships between employee cultural values and job attitudes and (2) whether the value-resistance relationships were stronger in some countries than in others. Results show that resistance mediated the cultural value-job attitude relationships, sometimes fully and sometimes partially, depending on which type of resistance (to teams or to self-management) and which type of cultural value was being examined. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

We can find (this is a culture version of arguments according to Barley and Kunda) that there are all sort sof positives associated with organizational commitment.

There seems to be a different level of commitment and satisfaction across cultures.

I have read variations in this paper before, but now it is all about teams vs selsf management, and the different notions of power distance, doing orientation, and determinism.

Also, that country will moderate the relationships.

What we find is that there are different cultural oreintations in different regions, us, asia, europe.

>Second, and perhaps most importantly, we ex- tended previous research that showed differences in satisfaction and commitment across cultures but did not explain why (Luthans et al., 1985; Palich et al., 1995; Sommer et al., 1996). Specifically, we found that resistance behavior accounted for some, and in a few cases all, of the variance between cultural values and both satisfaction and commit- ment. Thus, at least in U.S. multinationals, our data suggest that satisfaction and commitment level dif- ferences across multiple affiliates can be explained in part by differences in employee reactions to United States-based management initiatives p. 2001

Resistance to self-managemetn and team-management differs by country

WE find that cultural values are mediated by more specific notions of work (like resistance to teams)

Cultural values may matter more in places with specific constellations of values
>In other words, there is lower pressure for confor- mity, more freedom to question superiors, an em- phasis on work activities, and a strong belief that one can take action to effect significant change, perhaps by resisting management initiatives. It may thus behoove managers and scholars interested in employee resistance to management initiatives to be aware of the potential influence that cultural values may have on employee resistance-espe- cially in countries low in collectivism, power dis- tance, and determinism and high on a doing orien- tation. p566
