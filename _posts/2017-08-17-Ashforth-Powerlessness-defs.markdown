Abstract: Powerlessness is defined as a lack of autonomy and participation. Unexpected or undesired powerlessness is argued to generate, sequentially, reactance, helplessness, and work alienation. These stages are further argued to be mediated or moderated by generalized expectations of control, social isolation, the perceived legitimacy of organizational controls, and expectations of advancement. Self-report data from 206 nonsupervisory production employees with up to 2 years organizational tenure provided partial support for the model. Implications for theory, management, and research are discussed.


Furthering the discussion of Alienation, we look into more modern implementations of these ideas. This paper works from the idea of a theory of "work adjustment" and in particular - "how organizational newcomers reconcile their initial epections of and desiresfor power with a work environment that is not likely to meet these expectations"

One question is, when individuals begin working at an organization and become disillusioned, are reactance, helplessness and alienation alternatives or sequentially related? Ashforth argues for the sequential part. Here we have a three step model

1. Reactance - individuals experience organizational frustration when they cannot organize their work in the way that they would like. Sometimes we see organizational frustration here. This frustration will increase if there is less control. Reactance means resistance like behavior, and the more powerlessness an individual might have, the more they might resist. As resistance stops working, individuals move on.
Some factors deal with resistance, including percieved legitimacy of control, and the expectations of control. It is also worse if individuals are more socially isolated.

2. Helplessness

The idea is that the more powerless a person is at their job, the more helpless they will feel.  This will usually happen after a person resists.  Higher powerlessness means more resistance and helplessness. Lower powerlessness means greater reactance and the less helplessness.

3. Work Alienation

Eventually this leads to alienation, where individuals are alienated. Here alienation is thought of as individuals who stop using their occupational status as a benchmark against which to evaluate themselves, and view work as a means to other ends rather than an end in itself.  Once one realizes they are helpless, they are more likely to feel alienated, and the same with powerless.


#### Sampling

Newcomers in a blue collar organization were studied in different plants with different levels of bureaucracy and unionization. People were given likert type scales where they were asked on a scale how much they felt certain things. They find these things generally group together in the analysis as they planned it. They basically test to see if some variables are moderators for other ones and use this to make sense of how and if people move through stages of helplessness.
