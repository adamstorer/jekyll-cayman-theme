Abstract: "I present a brief review of problems in the sociological study of culture, followed by an integrated, interdisciplinary view of culture that eschews extreme contextualism and other orthodoxies. Culture is defined as the conjugate product of two reciprocal, componential processes. The first is a dynamically stable process of collectively made, reproduced, and unevenly shared knowledge structures that are informational andmeaningful, internally embodied, and externally represented and that provide predictability, coordination equilibria, continuity, and meaning in human actions and interactions. The second is a pragmatic component of culture that grounds the first, and it has its own rules of usage and a pragmatically derived structure of practical knowledge. I also offer an account of change and draw on knowledge activation theory in exploring the microdynamics of cultural practice and propose the concept of cultural configuration as a better way of studying cultural practice in highly heterogeneous modern societies where people shift between multiple, overlapping configurations."

    Schemata for Patterson: "Schemata are mental shortcuts that organize and process incoming information and perceptions in the light of previously stored knowledge structures and processes about given objects, concepts, events, and evaluations."p.10
    Mental Models for Patterson: nonschemataic forms of knowledge which are specific knowledge structures that are constructed to represent a new situation through the use of generic knowledge of space, time, causality, and human intentionality. These are our naive working theories of the world.
    What are scripts for Patterson: A type of procedural  knowledge that is a cultural algorithm. Stored knowledge of a predetermined stereotyped sequence of actions
    Particularized Values: cognitively and sociologically similar to attitudes, except that they are shared. One values a specific entity with some degree of favorability or disfavorability
    Norms for Patterson: Norms constitute the second major component of the evaluative domain. Norms are shared rules that prescribe and proscribe what we ought to do in given situations, unlike values, which express what we like or desire to do.
    What is knowledge activation?: Knowledge activation refers to the cognitive processes involved in the retrieval and use of cultural knowledge. Four processes are involved- (a) the availability of cultural knowledge, (b) its accessibility, (c) its application to particular situations and contexts, and (d ) the degree of self-regulation that people bring to bear on the other three processes.

Basically sociology of culture is difficult and there is fighting about it everywhere. The worst part is that everyone is always trying to carve out new agendas.

## Divisions in Cultural Sociology

Patterson argues here are three divisions in cultural sociology particularly with respect to meaning.
1. Sociocultural approach - the focus is on cultural knowledge structures and their uses in given social contexts. Meaning is something that is conveyed or signified in a fairly transparent way, like in Berger and Luckman.  
2. Meaning as subjective and instersubjective understanding - understanding how someone understands or makes sense of themselves and their world regardless of its objective validity.  Here Patterson argues:
>It
is arguable whether the act of interpretation,
expected of most analysts, does not distort and
misrepresent the understandings being conveyed,
an issue that led Bourdieu to scour such
studies, including phenomenological attempts
to resolve the matter p. 4

3. Cultural and Social Semiotics - The study of language, symbols, rituals, metaphors, codes, etc. These semiotic studies also have many divisions, flowing from Geertz, maybe Focuault? The second comes from American Pragmatism. The third is from Durkheim and Mauss as well as early Bourdieu.

## Assumptions and Propositions

![Patterson's Image]({{"/assets/patterson-image.png" =400x| absolute_url}} )

For Patterson culture is two interconnected components. The basic processes are shared and internally embodied and externally represented. This is the predictable level which human interaction requires to do some sort of shared meaning.

But while culture is predictable, it is also dynamic. Therefore it makes sense to study somewhat smaller cultural configurations rather than large cultural formations. For instance, it's a bit difficult to study something like american culture.  

Also, culture should be interactional and probabilistic. Also, people do not make new meanings all the time, and instead tend to harmonize themselves with their peers.

## The Nature and Dynamics of Cultural Knowledge

1. Cultural Knowledge as Shared and Common Meaningful Information - Important here is that it must be shared.
2. Shared Schemata and Reasonings - The Cognitive Basis of Culture. We've all got to do some categorizing and we really should understand how cognitive processing is important, for instance: Our categories allow us to understand things iwth minimal effort and they give us ready made inferences.This is relatd to our schemata and mental models.
<def>Schemata for Patterson: "Schemata are mental shortcuts that organize and process incoming information and perceptions in the light of previously stored knowledge structures and processes about given objects, concepts, events, and evaluations."p.10</def>
<def>Mental Models for Patterson: nonschemataic forms of knowledge which are specific knowledge structures that are constructed to represent a new situation through the use of generic knowledge of space, time, causality, and human intentionality. These are our naive working theories of the world.</def>

Patterson argues mental models are redundant, because if they are SHARED mental maps, they become schemata.

3. Domains of Cultural Knowledge Structures - Declarative Procedural and Evaluative
Declarative knowledge is knowledge of facts, procedural knowledge is knowing how to do things.

>We distinguish broadly between internal or embodied and external declarative schemata, the former referring to beliefs, ideologies, language,metaphor, and so on (Larson 1994, p. 20), the latter to artifacts, social rituals, conventions, and the more formal, structured conventions we call institutions (for more finegrained distinctions, seeWyer 2007).However, the distinction is largely one of analytic convenience. All external knowledge must, in the final analysis, bementally interpreted. And although there are purely internal schemata, most realize their meanings in context. p.11

Procedural knowledge comes in routines and scripts, and procedural knowledge is similar to Bourdieu's type of habitus. It is this procedural knowledge that is really of interest to me.
<def>What are scripts for Patterson: A type of procedural  knowledge that is a cultural algorithm. Stored knowledge of a predetermined stereotyped sequence of actions</def>
There are also routines, which are either individual or divisional, i.e. done by an individual person or many people.

Evaluative knowledge - This is when people value things. As Weber argues, we look at how values operate between the viewpoints of a specifically particularized character and ultimate and final values in which the meaning of existence is routed.
<def>Particularized Values: cognitively and sociologically similar to attitudes, except that they are shared. One values a specific entity with some degree of favorability or disfavorability</def>
People forget about valus, but many argue that values are stable and can be extremely influential.

>One reason for the untenable view that values
are unimportant is the failure to take account
of the distinction between espoused values
and values in use or experiential values,
the former referring to what people consciously
and usually publicly espouse, the latter to what
automatically drives their behavior...Furthermore, espoused values,
however hypocritical, may be consequential.
The public espousal of a value may well
eventually influence its use among a greater
number of persons through what Meglino &
Ravlin (1998, p. 384) call a “feedback loop in the
value process.” If people in a formerly racist or
sexist community feel compelled always to espouse
the value that they are not sexist or racist,
this may eventually result in a significant reduction
in racist and sexist behavior, as appears to
have happened in the United States over the
decades following the civil rights revolution. p.13

<def>Norms for Patterson: Norms constitute the second major component of the evaluative domain. Norms are shared rules that prescribe and proscribe what we ought to do in given situations, unlike values, which express what we like or desire to do.</def>

There is some notion that different levels of values coincide with different levels of norms. For instance formal norms with particular values.

Patterson argues institutions are norms or an ensemble of norms giving weight to objects and actions.

>Clearly, all this encoding, storing, and channeling of perceptions, however externally represented and phenomenologically experienced as objectively real (Zucker 1977) must in the final analysis be processed in the minds of people. Less complex institutional norms, such as salutations or the etiquette of interaction in public places (Goffman 1967), are learned during socialization or by osmosis through familiarity with a taken-for-granted reality. Others, like property rights or organizational rules, must be studied prior to practice. The most complex, however, such as the ensemble of procedures for docking a warship, become familiar primarily through enactment because the norms and rules of procedure, embedded in organizational structures or elaborate routines, only emerge interactively, p.16

## Cultural Pragmatics
How do people use cultural rules in interaction?
>Like language, culture has “a dual mode of
existence. It appears both in human projects
and intersubjectively as a structure or system”
(Sahlins 2000, p. 286) (but for a critique of the
Sausserian distinction and a too literal use of it,
which we take account of in what follows, see
Bourdieu 1977, pp. 22–30). As with language,
every individual has her own distinctive mode
of interacting and behavior that varies with the
intention, context, and style of communicating
between actors. p.16  

These power and status differences show when rules can and can't be broken, nand by who. Who is the unspoken right person to fit a role,etc.

There is also group style, which shows recurrent patterns of interaction that arise froma  group's shared assumptions about what constitutes good or adequate participation in the group setting.

>More recently, network researchers (including
the specialized group who work on organizational
behavior) have risen to the challenge,
noted by Emirbayer & Goodwin (1994) two
decades ago, of incorporating cultural knowledge
structures in their analyses. In moving
from the structural channels of networks to
a consideration of contagion, or what flows
through them, Christakis & Fowler (2009)
have independently advanced the epidemiological
model of cultural transmission and change.
Cultural knowledge, norms, and values flow
through the pipes of networks, powerfully influencing
behaviors such as eating, smoking,
and even feeling happy, and these hyperdyadic
network spreads have emergent properties,
with major consequences for our understanding
of the production and reproduction of cultural
processes (Christakis & Fowler 2009, pp. 24–
25, 116–17). They may even influence future
network composition (Vaisey & Lizardo 2010). p.19

Pragmatically sometimes certain knowledge is activated
<def>What is knowledge activation?: Knowledge activation refers to the cognitive processes involved in the retrieval and use of cultural knowledge. Four processes are involved- (a) the availability of cultural knowledge, (b) its accessibility, (c) its application to particular situations and contexts, and (d ) the degree of self-regulation that people bring to bear on the other three processes. </def>
