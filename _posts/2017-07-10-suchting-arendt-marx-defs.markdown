## Part 1

Suchting is not happy with how Arendt characterizes the distinction between Work and Labor,nor how this is related to Marx.  For Arendt, we live in "society" and society means laborers who are commited to enjoying life in its purely biological sense, as in consumer goods. The single task of all people is consumption.

Suchting argues that Arend thinks real happiness requiress exertion and rest, and the movements between work and leisrure make life meaningless. If we are all automated, we lose the one activity that gives us meaning, the work that leads to sweet rest.

Arendt argues that emancipation from labor in Marx's own terms would ultimately mean emancipation from consumption as well, that is, from the metabolism with nature which is the very condition of human life." Arendt p1.31
So Arendt is arguing that Marx's society would leave people simply as meaningless laborers. So what does Marx say?


## Part 2
Marx saw labor as the things that differentiated man (but I thought there was a point in estranged labor where he talked about contemplation/consciousness as a part of this conversation)
Marx saw this labor, though, in a similar way to how Arendt saw "labor."
But Suchting's point doesn't really hold here, right? Arendt wants to DISTINGUISH between something that is undistinguished in Marx - between two types of laboring - and Marx draws on both at the same time.

Suchting continues to argue along the same lines, saying that Marx meant two types of labor, and so when he says he wants to abolish labor he only meant one type.
But then he goes on to point out that argument of estrangement. Man is estranged from the product and the productive act,which means his time is alien to him. This line of theorizing is not in the forefront of Arendt, who distinguishes work by the product, rather than who OWNS the work.
Basically, by taliking about human activity and who owns it, Marx sidesteps a lot of the ontology that Arendt sees as important. But the point of Arendt still holds, that the things one does with one's time, if not categorized or not changed in some deep way, may not take on some other fundamental characteristics that Arendt identifies.

BUt even what one does with one's time (consume) is apparently covered by Marx:
>Within the economic system of capitalism, Marx says, the aim of man is production and the aim of production is wealth. Production is carried on, not for the sake of people but, in the final analysis, for the sake of production itself. He contrasts this with, for example, the state of affairs in ancient Greece (and presumably Rome-he refers to "the ancients") where "wealth never appears as the aim of production. . . . The inquiry always concerns the sort of property that creates the best citizen

I think this paper is a little over protective of Marx, but brings up a good point. I think Marx's argument has kind of a parsimonious scalability to it that distinguishing between 'work' and 'labor' does not necessarily have. I wonder what some kind of combination of these two arguments would look like...
