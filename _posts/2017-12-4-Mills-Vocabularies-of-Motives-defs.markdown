We disagree with the argument that language is the expression of elements within the individual. Instead, we approach linguistic behavior by observing its social function of coordinating diverse actions. Language is taken by othe rpersons as an indicator of future actions.

So what of motivation?

<def>For Mills, motives are what?: atypical vocabularies having ascertainable functions in delimited societal situations. Motives are the terms with which interpretation of conduct by social actors proceeds</def>

There are really two ways of looking at motives:
1. Explain behavior by referring it to an inferred and abstract motive.
2. Analyze the observable lingual mechanisms of motive imputation and avowal as they function in conduct.

# How does motive imputation and avowal occure?
Motive is a social thing, because there is some action with respect to others. Unexpected actions require explanation, and the explanation is read back as motive?
That is, motives are in response to situational consequences of questioned conduct. An intent involves awareness of some consequence.

The main argument is that since action is social, with social consequences, motivations are social and not based on some internal system. I'm not sure how I feel about this.

>In a societal situation, implicit in the names for con- sequences is the social dimension of motives. Through such vocabularies, types of societal controls operate. Also, the terms in which the question is asked often will contain both alternatives: "Love or Duty?", "Business or Pleasure?" Institutionally different situations have different vocabularies of motive appropriate to their respective behaviors

This approach looks at individuals from the outside. It translates questions of why into how. But this is not enough, right?

>A satisfactory or adequate motive is one that satisfies the questioners of an act or program, whether it be the other's or the actor's. As a word, a motive tends to be one which is to the actor and to the other members of a situation an unquestioned answer to ques- tions concerning social and lingual conduct. A stable motive is an ultimate in justificatory conversation. The words which in a type situation will fulfil this function are circumscribed by the vocabulary of motives acceptable for such situations. Motives are accepted justifications for present, future, or past programs or acts. p.907

When stating their motives, peole try to give reasons to influence others and himself. Often he is finding new reasons. The verbalization is a new act.

But we still don't know why they did the thing. Often times they do somethign with some generalized other enforcing social control.

>As lingual segments of social action, motives orient actions by enabling discrimination between their objects. Adjectives such as "good," "pleasant," and "bad" promote action or deter it. When they constitute components of a vocabulary of motives, i.e., are typical and relatively unquestioned accompaniments of typal situations, such words often function as directives and incentives by virtue of their being the judg- ments of others as anticipated by the actor. In this sense motives are "social instruments, i.e., data by modifying which the agent will be able to influence [himself or others]." p08

Remember, we cannot really get to some real attitutde or motive, because all we can ever really see are verbalizations.

When we ask for theal motive rather than the rationalization, all we can meaningfully be asking for is the controlling speech form which incipiently or overtly presented in th performed act or series of act.s

>As I see it, motives are circumscribed by the vocabulary of the actor. The only source for a terminology of motives is the vocabularies of motives actually and usually verbalized by actors in specific situations. p910

WE need to compartmentalize operative motives in personalities according to the situation and the general types and conditions of vocabluaries of motives in various types of societies.
# What are the terms of motive and the paradigm under which certain motives are verbalized?

What are the mechanisms linking vocabularies of motive to systems of action.

Basically, the idea is to understand motives by locating them within some general vocabularies.

>Rather than interpreting actions and language as external manifesta- tions of subjective and deeper lying elements in individuals, the research task is the locating of particular types of action within typal frames of nor- mative actions and socially situated clusters of motive. There is no explana- tory value in subsuming various vocabularies of motives under some term- inology or list. Such procedure merely confuses the task of explaining specific cases. The languages of situations as given must be considered a valuable portion of the data to be interpreted and related to their condi- tions. To simplify these vocabularies of motive into a socially abstracted terminology is to destroy the legitimate use of motive in the explanation of social actions. p.913

This is a take that I need to sit with more and try and make sense of. I think the takeaway here is that the act of describing a motivation is a specific linguistic account, and we can never get to some true motivation because we can't see internal states. By making sense of "lingual vocabularies" or something like that, then we can make sense of how different vocabularies vary with other things that we see. This is a take that is interesting.
