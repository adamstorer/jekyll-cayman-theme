I think the general idea is that a modern notion of power in which we took control of the person through discipline seems to have worked its way into prisons. We control everything about the people's soul, the way they do in other ways. People end up watching themselves or at least have a feeling of always being watched, and must ask disciplined at all times. This is a diffusion of control and power which is local and more diffused.

>The widespread dispersal of the disciplines among social institutions was a crucial ingredient, accord- ing to Foucault, in the takeoff of modern industrial capitalism and democratic politics (review piece)



# John Lie's Notes
Context of Foucault

Existentialism - Sartre

Structuralism - Levi-Strauss
American Structuralism - Structures in the sense of buildings/obstacles. What structure is is a set of obstacles that will shape your fate. Consider structural variables which are independent variables which have determining/shaping influx on your outcomes.
French Structuralism - Structures are rules. languages (saussure) who made a fundamental distinction between langue and parole, langue = language, parole = discussion. The structure of language is very deep, something embedded deeply that you can’t see.
Post-Structuralism - Structuralism is too deterministic! Structures are unstable, or structures have history/are made.

Moves of Foucault
Turn upside conceived wisdom - madness, with the progress of psychiatry there should be less madness, but rather than the triumph, there is a rupture in the nature of psychiatry.
Etymological rupture - the whole structure of thinking shifts or breaks. the idea of madness in renaissance isn’t the same one we have today.
The triumphalist narrative hides social control, rather than liberating this thing, modern psychiatry enslaves the patient.

4 Parts of Discipline and Punish. What’s in each part/chapter. What is the function each section serves.

Part 1 - Sets up the problem, you are totrutred and punishd physically and repeatedly, and the picture of prison life where everything is rational, almost scientific.
The received narrative is that this is a story of humanization/progress and science.
Three important ideas -
1. Microphysics of power, we like to think there is one singular top down power. Foucault says power comes from different places, but it is not univocal, it is multifocal.
2. Power/Knowledge - conventional understanding is that you can produce knowledge when you’re freed form power. It’s easy to see power producing knowledge. Knowledge comes from patronage, it’s alls bout the money. The constitution of the object of knowledge is produced by power, they are intimately intertwined.
3. History of the pResent - he’s studying the past as an intervention into the present.

Transition from sovereign to modern mode! Torture to discipline
the  collapse of the sovereign mode of punishment, introduces the role of the people.
Sometimes the punishment actually undermines the purpose of the punishment in the torturous way of looking at it.

Part 2 - 18th century reformers were progressive, tries to fix the system. They were not so much against the cruelty but about the inefficient economy of power. reformers were interested in targeting two fronts
1. the superpower of the sovereign, the random exercise of power, and
2. infra-power, or tolerated illegalities. In any social settings there are rules and laws if there’s a centralized power, but there aren’t laws for every social action and even if they are laws they’re not always exercised.

The idea is to curb sovereign power and fix increase infra power. The whole system shifts from one against the crime to one agains the criminal. This is the epistemic shift, the object of punishment has different possibilities. The punitive city is one. One in which the economy of punishment revolves around you, if you do x you get punished by y, in a framework like if you stele you get your hand chopped off. Prison was not necessarily that was going to happen, there were some other options!

Part 3 - The point is that you breka down and rearrange bodies time and space. The modern form of discipline depends on analytically breaking down and rearranging bodies in time and space. The punchline is that there is this military dream of society, create a very efficient machine of action that pervades every part of society. How the people exercise,  how individuals are observed, judged, and examined. Why does science grow in the nineteenth century, **it is because these categories that are necessary for such things, like the examination, develop in a disciplinary society.** Panopticism  as the formation of disciplinary society, three fundamental forces and causes:
1. econ/demographic - the rise of large society need for control
2. juridicail/political - rise of modern democracy and the regime of individual liberty. 3. can everyone be free? no dark side fundamentally dependent on discipline/control
scientific/rise of human science  -p.227

Why prison, that’s what it is? That’s why things all look the same.

Part 4 - insists on this circular/self justifying character of prison. the things wrong with the prison and the prison coevolve.

In the old system crime and punishment are put together

in the new system criminal creates crime creates punishment.

we know through science who the criminals are through biography, through sociology/crime.

criticisms against prison - building prison doesn’t lower crime rates because there are more criminals because you imprision them more, it leads to recidivism.

by imprisoning it sets up this norm about reforming the poor people, it also solves the confusion, it also generates the politic sod fear.

-
What was the world like before the category of observation was constructed by the disciplinary society? It must have been weird walking around and not having anyone observe you! Anyone see when you’re doing something that was considered wrong? But what is wrong? These things like stealing, murdering,r aping, are just constructucts of the disciplinary society? To go around stealing and murdering and have no one able to see that its wrong and no one able to see when I’m murdering?

how convenient to not be held to the limits of what actually exists in constructing a theory!


my argument:

we don’t know what we’re talking about at all anymore!

the world has changed in a fundamental way, we used to always say exactly what we meant and now we never say what we meant, the politics of parlance has shifted totally upside dow

i mean, look, we are upside down all the time, look at yoga, we are always doing headstands and handstands, look at how gymnastics operate. these are essential ideal types to understanding how we are upside down

and i mean, what if you tried to eat while doing the headstands we’re always doing, we’d have to use our foots to eat. I mean, we always have our foot in our mouths! Don’t you see?

## OLD NOTES
Exploring the disappearance of torture as a public spectacle
Really two things are happening:
1) The disappearance of punishment as a spectacle
2) The dying down of torture as a whole, changed to work camps

“it was as if the punishment was thought to equal, if not to exceed, the crime itself”

### DECLINE OF THE SPECTACLE AND THE STATES CONTROL OF THE BODY. now punishment is to decline the person a right or freedom, not to punish the body

Four principles of the study, to understand how the ‘modern soul’ goes on trial
1)see punishment in terms of the positive effects they’re supposed to have (complex social function)
2)punishment as a political tactic
3)show how punishment goes hand in hand with the development of technology
4) see the soul as entering into  power relations, see how it coincides with the development of body in power relations

## PUNISHMENT

How do you explain the decline in punishment, the movement from punishment as severe to less severe, the change from crime from more violent to less violent, and more importantly,the notion of punishment as accepting the humanity beyond the criminal, as assuming that all things have a level of humanity, even punishment?

“it was an effort to adjust the mechanisms of power that frame the everyday lives of individuals; an adaptation and a refinement of the machinery that assumes responsibility for and places under surveillance their everyday behavior, their identity, their apparently unimportant gestures” 77

this term, the illegality of rights, is a big part of the change, especially the illegality of property rights. it is the illegality of rights instead of that of the human?

part of this is the shift to capitalism, the change in the structure of the accumulation of wealth requires a reformulation of property and ownership that with it requires a reformulation of right and wrong.

part of it was that under capitalism you can’t have laws applied haphazardly.

but  when a person steals under capitalism it is a threat to the whole body, and thus the whole body has legitimate power to punish. this boundless power requires some principle of moderation

Rules of punishment (94)
Minimum Quantity: take away enough of the advantages to make the crime not worth it
suffidient ideality: you have to create the idea of displeasure
lateral effects: most intense effects on those who haven’t committed the crime
perfect certainty: you must know the punishment with certainty
common truth: it must be true that the person committed the crime for the crime to be punished
optimal specification: you must know the types of crimes and there must be a known punishment for a particular type of crime

you still havne’tnecessarily understood the ‘criminal man’ but you have codified all of th e rules

The Gentle Way in Punishment
Conditions of General Punishment
1. Unarbirtrary - to the symmetry of vengeance but the transparency of the “sign to that which it signifies”
2. “The complex of signs must engage with the mechanics of forces”- the punishment must seem lively and more immediate than the act itself. IN other words, you s”set the force that drove the criminal to the crime against itself.”
3.  “Use a temporal modulation.” it must end at some point, once the convict can become virtuous again. in the old days time was used as a “time of ordeal, not of concerted transformation.”
4.  The types of punishment must ciruculte rapidly and widely, must be accepted and redistributed by all
5. “Economy of Publicity” - it must be based on a lesson, not on some sort of horror. one makes the law known by punishing by it. punishment should be a school rather than a festival
6. There is no longer any glory in criminality

These punishments generally vary in nature, with imprisonment only one part ofit.

so how does incarceration take form? in only a short period of time the punishment as example to all becomes imprisonmebnt.

punishment and reform are between the prisoner and the supervisor, are less in the sights of the public

there is a divergence between the french type of ‘punitive city’ and the more american ‘coercive institution.’

but the prison also institutionalizes the power to punish.

it comes down to wehter you are reinstating the rules for everyone or if you are reforming the rule breakers

## DISCIPLINE
it’s all about the micro-physics of power that is inside the body, which can only be found by looking in the coherence of a tactic, rather than in some pre-determined rational frame.

The Age of Distributions
“Discipline proceeds from the distribution of individuals in space: (what is going on here? p.148)
1. Enclosure - the specification of a place heterogeneous to all other and closed in upon itself.  The barracks, the prison, the school, the factory
2.  partitioning- the disciplinary ‘cell’
3. Functioanl sites - create a useful space, like a hospital
4. rank - the place one occupies in a classification. as you move around in terms off the unit of domination and the unit of residence, it is the rank that is the most important, even as people move around in ranks, such as in a class, thety are still part of the disciplinary structure

The Control of Activity
1) The Time table - regulates the processes of repetition
2) Temporal elaboration of the act - march to the rhythm of a drum and also set out the exact times that particular movements are supposed to take. sets out exactly what a gesture should be like
3) Correlation of the body andy he gesture - to gesture correctly requires a correct fuse of the body
4) body-object articulation - there is a separation articulated between the body and object, for instance in a gesture you have to manage what your’e doing with your body and how the object should be oriented
5) exhaustive use -to not be idle means you are using your time, and all of it! this is what the control of activity is in its purest form


“The ‘seriation’ of successive activities makes possible a whole investment of duration by power: the possibility of characterizing, and therefore of using individuals according to the level in the series that they are moving through” p.160\

four types of individuality: cellular (spatial distribution), organic (by the coding of activities), it is genetic (by the accumulation of time), it is combinatory (by the composition of forces)

simple instruments of disciplinary power:
hierarchical observation - ‘techniques that make it possible to see induce effects of power’ the disciplinary gee makes it possible to see everything at all times, present in the school, architecture, and factory, an insidious extension of an old ida. “discipline makes possible the operation of a relational power that sustains itself by its own mechanism and which, for the spectacle of public eventss substitutes the uninterrupted play of calculated gazes.’ p.177
normalizing judgement - discipling brings the action to a whole, it differentiates individuals, the rule is minima, measures and hierarchies the nature individuals , it gives values, it traces the limits to relationships in all other aspects of life. this i what normalizing means
the examination - we are entering the age of infinite examination and of compulsory objectification. ‘the emanation also introduces individuality into the field of documentation.’

Panopticism
functions as a laboratory of power, a generalizble model of functioning

discipline may be identified neither with an institution nor with an apparatus; it is a type of power, a modality for its exercise, comprising a whole set of interments, techniques, procedures”

legal punishments and the panopticon “the prison with all the corrective technology at its disposal is to be restated at the point where the codified power to punish turns into a disciplinary power to observe.” p.224

“what generalizes the power to punish then is not the universal consciousness of the law in each juridicial subject; it si the regular extension, the infinitely minute web of panoptic techniques
