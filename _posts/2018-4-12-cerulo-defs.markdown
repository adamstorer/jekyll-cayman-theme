WHat's up with the variable salience of mental categories. It pulls on four modes of cognition:
1. Sensation/Attention
2. Discriminations/Classifications
3. REpresentation/Integration
4. Storage/Retrieval


# Chapter 8 - Individualism Pro Term - Reconsidering US Social Relations

Are individuals really becoming so individualized and self centered?
>In an effort to answer these questions, this chapter sets as its goal four specific
tasks. First, I present a wide variety of data on American attitudes and behaviors circa
1965 to 1995. In so doing, I challenge claims of a growing American individualism.
Data reporting what Americans of this era actually thought and did reveal that the
growth of individualism was and is limited in scope and, in many cases, a temporary
phenomenon. After demonstrating that historical data do not confirm fears of a growing
individualism, I begin to explore the reasons why such claims emerge and persist.
Specifically, Section II of this chapter examines two critical practices: social scientists’
fixed conceptualization of social relations, and cultural producers’ periodic projection
of unithematic scripts of social relations. The section fully defines these practices and
outlines the ways in which these activities can misdirect both popular and scholarly
perceptions of individualism’s presence p. 136

So are we really becoming more individualistic? NO! Arguments about anomie and lack of relations persist, but htey are based on little. But really there is a temporary flirtation with indiivdiualism. Abortion rates, "individual freedom number 1" decreased from 81-95.Violent crime ratesalso decreased. People also started to major less in business.
The problem is partially the fact that the "me" generation is totally made up.

There is osme info that people have been more alone, getting divorced at higher rates. People also spent more time doing personal grooming.

We also see community oriented activities are relatively stable. We also see that people do not really lose faith in things over time.

So why do these claims persist?

We are predisposed to a linear model, which has a fixed conceptualization. We have a cultural script of individualism.

In sociology and in life we think of things bipolarly, individualism or not. It is an either-or vantage point. So we really have  this unithematic way of thinking about things - as one or the other.

>I will demonstrate that the years
1970 to 1984 represent one of several American historical periods marked by the
production of unithematic cultural scripts—in this case, scripts of individualism. In
the 1970s and 1980s, scripts of individualism saturated the cultural arena. Products
and images of the era presented individualism as America’s controlling force. In so
doing, cultural scripts promoted the notion that a single relational form constituted
American society. Because this cultural message was so forceful and targeted, I
argue, it breathed new life into the linear model. Saturating the field with cultural
scripts of individualism functioned to strengthen the theoretical status quo p.148

So we see the spread of a unithematic cultural script - ndividualism. There used to be more multithematic cultural norms from 1965-69, but starting in 1970 it became a sim;ler notion of individualism.

For instance, in 1970 we moved from groups to solo acts. The individual became part of the script, in the foreground, in many parts of popular culture, including music, books and movies, as well as sports.

But, "individualism" was short lived, and new cultural scripts showed up.

We see in court decisions and research, as well as other things, that individualism is a short-lived cultural script. , ending around 1980.

The scripts that we saw did not reflect many actual social changes. Here ewe have "diffuse instability" - and when one didn't know what weas going on, we could rely on a simple cultural script - individualism.
Diffuse instability is - social change and social uncertainty, spread among many different sectors or society.

For instance, in the economy we had stagflation, which was something we couldn't really make sense of. We also had watergate which we didn't know what to do with. We also lost in Vietnam. Science seemed tot kae us into uncharted territory. HIV also scared people.

# LInking the Cultural and the Social

What do we say about diffuse instability with respect to individualism?

The scripts are a reaction - a univocal way of  thinking about personal control in a time when there was no stability.

>I argue that in any given era, cultural producers
have an array of institutionalized scripts at their disposal: scripts of civic community
(e.g., “we’re all one people”), scripts of pluralism (e.g., “America is a melting pot”),
scripts of bilateral conflict (e.g., “it’s them versus us”), and so on. They may choose
to project several of these messages simultaneously, or, as was true from 1970 to
1984, they may emphasize one script over all other available “tools. p.160

Producers may opt for unithematic scripts when there are periods of change and we need an easilyrecognizable system of meaning. Here we have

>Based on ongoing analysis, I argue, for example, that individualized innovation
represents the most common message in conditions of diffuse instability. In the face
of broad-based yet manageable change and uncertainty, cultural producers seem
inclined to issue a “hands-on” appeal that encourages “everyman/woman” to “break
frame,” take personal control, and create new solutions and new strategies of organizing
activity.p.161


In a sense, we have "cultural scripts" which we can go to, and we make the mistake of seeing things in terms of these scripts rather than seeing the empirical reality.

There is not only individualism or community, but four types - individualism, pluralism, bilateralism, and communalism. Really these definitions cross cut american life.
