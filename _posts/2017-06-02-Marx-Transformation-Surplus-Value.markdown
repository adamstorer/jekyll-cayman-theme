# Capital Volume 1
## Part 7, Chapter 24
## The Conversion of Surplus-Value into Capital

Access the reading [here](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch24.htm#S1).

### Section 1
Accumulation of Capital - Employing surplus-value as capital, reconverting it into capital

As production continues, one must first replenish everything you used when producing a good, and then there is extra product, which is used to make more, to accumulate. We don't care about the portion of surplus value that the capitalist consumes, only that which is reconverted into capital.

But that reconversion is at the cost of someone, the laborer. It is not the fruits of a capitalists labor, but the fruits of others that result in the wealth of the capitalist.

> At first the rights of property seemed to us to be based on a man’s own labour. At least, some such assumption was necessary since only commodity-owners with equal rights confronted each other, and the sole means by which a man could become possessed of the commodities of others, was by alienating his own commodities; and these could be replaced by labour alone. Now, however, property turns out to be the right, on the part of the capitalist, to appropriate the unpaid labour of others or its product, and to be the impossibility, on the part of the labourer, of appropriating his own product.

The key to this is that, by selling labor power, you alienate yourself from the use value of your labor, allowing it to be co-opted by the capitalist.

>The relation of exchange subsisting between capitalist and labourer becomes a mere semblance appertaining to the process of circulation, a mere form, foreign to the real nature of the transaction, and only mystifying it. The ever repeated purchase and sale of labour-power is now the mere form; what really takes place is this — the capitalist again and again appropriates, without equivalent, a portion of the previously materialised labour of others, and exchanges it for a greater quantity of living labour.

And a lot of this turns on the laborer selling his labor power as a commodity.


### Section 2
I think part of the argument in this section is that there was actually an ideological project involved in teaching individuals to accumulate capital.
>it was extremely important for bourgeois economy to promulgate the doctrine that accumulation of capital is the first duty of every citizen, and to preach without ceasing, that a man cannot accumulate, if he eats up all his revenue, instead of spending a good part of it in the acquisition of additional productive labourers, who bring in more than they cost.

Note that other economists think this accumulation of surplus value ends with laborers consuming it - but in reality there is always stuff left over for the capitalists. This gets ignored and that's a huge problem for other economists. By failing to make sense of what is really going on with the accumulation of capital that does not turn into laborers wages, these economists are acting in the interests of the capitalist class.


### Section 3
The more capitalists DO  NOT consume of their surplus value, the more they accumulate.
>Fanatically bent on making value expand itself, he ruthlessly forces the human race to produce for production’s sake; he thus forces the development of the productive powers of society, and creates those material conditions, which alone can form the real basis of a higher form of society, a society in which the full and free development of every individual forms the ruling principle.

And a little later
>Moreover, the development of capitalist production makes it constantly necessary to keep increasing the amount of the capital laid out in a given industrial undertaking, and competition makes the immanent laws of capitalist production to be felt by each individual capitalist, as external coercive laws. It compels him to keep constantly extending his capital, in order to preserve it, but extend it he cannot, except by means of progressive accumulation.

It is really the abstinence, the necessity to not consume and to just continue to accumulate, which males the individual personified capital, and thus the mover of history.

### Section 4
This section seems fairly repetitive and gets into some logical next steps from previous sections. Here are some quotes that kind of make the general points

>General result: by incorporating with itself the two primary creators of wealth, labour-power and the land, capital acquires a power of expansion that permits it to augment the elements of its accumulation beyond the limits apparently fixed by its own magnitude, or by the value and the mass of the means of production, already produced, in which it has its being.

To maintain a profit it is also important that the productive power of labor increases at a greater rate than the rate of surplus-value...or something like that...

>The powerful and ever-increasing assistance given by past labour to the living labour process under the form of means of production is, therefore, attributed to that form of past labour in which it is alienated, as unpaid labour, from the worker himself, i.e., to its capitalistic form.


### Section 5
I can't help but including this insult:
>the arch-Philistine, Jeremy Bentham, that insipid, pedantic, leather-tongued oracle of the ordinary bourgeois intelligence of the 19th century

This section is about the "labor fund" something that Marx has a problem with. THe labor fund seems based on the notion that we can take all of the wages paid and divide by the number of workers and this is the amount of capital flowing through a country. But this is wrong because it is only one part of capital, and a small part because of all of the daed labor that makes up capital and capital innovations.

BUt we know most of the suprlus product doesn't go to the laborers. Here is the end of the chapter:
>The greater part of the yearly accruing surplus-product, embezzled, because abstracted without return of an equivalent, from the English labourer, is thus used as capital, not in England, but in foreign countries. But with the additional capital thus exported, a part of the “labour fund” invented by God and Bentham is also exported
