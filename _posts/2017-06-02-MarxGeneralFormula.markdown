## The General Formula for Capital

Once material trading gets under way, the use of money is inevitable.
Money, then, is the first form of capital.
This is true historically, but if you follow the logic, it is necessarily so.

#### Simple Commodity Circulation
C-M-C (commodity money commodity) - exchange commodity to money so that you can get more commodities

#### Advanced Commodity Circulation
M-C-M (money commodity money) - exchange money for commodities to get more money!
Here a commodity is bought *in order to be sold*

This would be ridiculous if it just exchanged two equal sums of money, you do it to make more money!!

You could trade some commodities at a higher version of some other commodity, but any gain or loss in value is accidental. In addition, the general meaning of exchanging goods is still there, whereas with M-C-M the general meaning tends to fall apart.

#### Making sense of M-C-M
When you exchange a commodity in order to end 10% on your initial investment, there is qualitatively the same amount of labor power in the commodity is there was before.

If the money is turned into a commodity, it is not Capital.
While C-M-C comes to a natural end, M-C-M is meant to continue indefinitely.

Consider this quote:
>The circulation of money as capital is, on the contrary, an end in itself, for the expansion of value takes place only within this constantly renewed movement. The circulation of capital has therefore no limits.

So when money is capital, the person preforming the M-C-M exchange is the capitalist.  
The appropriation of M becomes the sole desire.  

A note -  Is this a very special form of person, the person who truly does not want to ever exchange their wealth for commodities?_

A capitalist is essentially capital personified, and endowed with consciousness and a will. Use-values are NOT AT ALL the aim of the capitalist.

A note on Marx's "Jewish Question" here
>The capitalist knows that all commodities, however scurvy they may look, or however badly they may smell, are in faith and in truth money, inwardly circumcised Jews, and what is more, a wonderful means whereby out of money to make more money.

Anyway, that's pretty much it for this section. Money begetting money through capital takes a form not only for merchants but also for industrial cpaitalists spending money to make things to sell. Bankers are the deepest in this, since they seem to pretty much get rid of the need for Capital at all.
