    Traditional Marxist Outlook of Alienation at work: Lack of meaning and sulf-fulfillment in work without control over the product and process would lead toward a revoluationary outlool
    Alienation Aspect 1 (Blauner): Powerlessness due to machine systems
    Alienation Aspect 2 (Blauner): Meaninglessness due to the breaking down of work into little, boring aspects
    Alienation Aspect 3 (Blauner): Isolation due to because he had no legal or social claim to the work, annd would not identify with the work in any way, so you are isolated from the organized production and its goals, you are simply a cog
    Alienation Aspect 4 (Blauner): self-estrangement If work is simply a means to an end, a way to live, then you have no freedom, initiative, or creativity, you are separated from yourself. THis was the heart of it for marx, since productive work is supposed to be the expression of man's nature, becomes boring and  simply fulfilling the need to live.
    For Blauner, Alienation in a nutshell: unable to control immediate work process, develop a sense of purpose which connects their job to the organization or product, to belong to an integrated community, and when they fail to become involved in the activity of work as a mode of personal self expression
    Do low educated individuals find unchallenging work interesting or monotonous?: Interesting because they do not expect variety or inhererent interest, and do not define such jobs as monotonous

Blauner's treatment of Alienation is similar theoretically to Seeman's annual review. Seeman actually references Blauner to some extent. However, while Seeman conducts an analytical review of empirical and theoretical books/papers, Blauner is undergoing an empirical study, attempting to understand how different aspects of the organization of work comes to produced some level alienation.

THis idea goes well with factory work, which should be the next step in Alienation
Alienation is considered to have four aspects

<def>For Blauner, Alienation in a nutshell: unable to control immediate work process, develop a sense of purpose which connects their job to the organization or product, to belong to an integrated community, and when they fail to become involved in the activity of work as a mode of personal self expression</def>

There are some other definitions, but I think these give the general picture. IN chapter 3, Blauner shows that printers have it pretty good.
#### Chapter 4 - Textiles
Blauner points to five factors that are basic to textile work:
1. Machine Tredning Technology
2. Low Skill Level
3. Traditional social structure4. Location in small southern communities.
4. Economic Sickness
5. Large numbers of women (Blauner has a strange idea for women, and believes they are better suited to some work than others) hr

The textile workers are fairly powerless, sucbject to argritrary rule, have a lack of free physical freedom or choice in work techniques. So much to do they sometimes can't even stop for a drink of water. They also do not control the pace, and the largest percet of textile workers at all skill levels think the work moves too fast.

The mills also have an unpleasaant atmostphere, it is quite hot, and the air is full of lint. People call the ills prisons, sweatshops, or death holes.

Women have less power in the textile factories. Since the job is more phsyically demanding, more women believe the job is moving too quickly. The women also do not get to do any of the jobs that give some freedom, and just have to continue to work on the line. Women in the south have a really difficult time.

The workers do have some sense of community though, because they are ocatedin small towns or villages where other dominant social isntitutions bring poeple in. Women also sit and talk with each other while working sometimes.

In fact, the idea here is that the least alienating part of work is actually the non-work aspect of it -the fact that the job is integrated iwthin in already created community means that people feel more of a community aspect at work. This is inclusion in a different way, people feel they have to become textile workers, whereas printers more hae a kind of happy choice. These poeple are also notably uneducatdd. People in the textile industry do not htink much during their jobs, can often think about other things. Blauner argues that -
<def>Do low educated individuals find unchallenging work interesting or monotonous?: Interesting because they do not expect variety or inhererent interest, and do not define such jobs as monotonous</def>

These workers d not find their jobs to be too simple, even though they are quite mindless. The textile workers have low estimates of their own abilities.  p. 85

##### Are textile workers self-estranged?
IT seems that workers are relatively satisfied, but it does not provide an identity that is approved of by others, thus leading to lower self-esteem and lack of economic stability.

"The submissiveness required of a male textile workers must be damaging to the maintenance of a sure sense of masculinity" p.87

As a result, work here becomes a means to an end..

#### Chapter 5 - The Auto Worker
The autoworker is meant to be the most alienated group because of their work on the assembly line.

Lots of jobs are timed, and you are supposed to do them quickly, in a manner of seconds or minutes. The assembly line is highly monitored and mechanized. There is pretty much no control here. People who are off the conveyor belt like thier jobs a lot better. Instead of monotony, people feel rushed. There's also a lack of control over quanitity and a predestination of techniques.

Apparently, the auto industry is very socially isolated. I think this is part of the isolating work and the fact that you can't really talk with a regular person next to you on theline. However, the ability to talk and joke with other workers, when possible, would be the main reason someone liked their job. There is also very little intrinsic satisfaction with the work, and much more focus on the extrinsic qualities - such as relative pay and stability. Something about being on a line leave syou with little independence and dignity.


#### Chaterp 6 and 7 - Chemical workers

THese large chemical platns are mostly automated, so they have a very different job, caring for the machines rather than doing their bidding.Here the workers that have been left post-automoation are very scure in their jobs. Basically, because oil is so lucrative the companies tend to really take care of their employees.

WOrkers here have jobs that are more "mental" or "visual" than physical p.133 they get to work on a lot of idfferent problems, figuring out what's wrong with the machiens and fixing them..BY working in alarge automated plant, focusing on many things at once, Blauner argues you think more clearly about what you are making. Blauner thinks maybe becauseyou're not making something, but making a mchaine make something, you might feel more meaningless, but p.145 nobody had ever even considered this to be soemthing to think about.

A good bureaucratic structure also keeps people working correctly.

The alienation a person feels in this plant is staved off by organizational more than occupational commitment, since the plant treats you well, pays you well, and gives you lots of freedom/benefits, you would do anyting for it.


### Alienation and Freedom in Historical Perspective

Blauner argues that there are many things that go into feelings of alienation, from youth, intelligence, to organizational structure, to the work itself. To ask a question like, is factory work alienating, is there for too broad.

Factory work also differs, are you operating machines and a product to produce something, are you on a line, or are you monitoring automated processes. But in some ways, the automated processes give a freedom and satisfaction that is almonst like doing craft work. BUt there is also some autonomy in termsof when you get to do things, which is nice. HOwever, in no cases can you choose the techniques which you bring to the job.


There is a basic description of some of the themes we've seen here, but basically, I think there is a lot to disagree with from Blauner's perspective. That is, what makes people feel powerless, meaningless, etc. is difficult to quanitfy. Can we say, with some degree of self-assuredness that one job allows you to have more power over someone than another? Indeed I feel the organization of the work, socially, and the organizational culture, the commitments of the individual, must take precedence. It is not the material, but the immaterial, that determines where an individual will feel terrible. (At the same time, I get that people hate being on the line for hours and hours, but people can be rotated off to do other things or it could be slowed to a reasonable rate). But if working on the line sucks, then can't we say it's quantifiably worse? I think this is the big question that needs to be answered - the material conditions vs the immaterial attitudes and motivations.
