Goffman's book is all about how others interact with each other in order to do some kind of impression management. People try to make sense of others based on the clues they give, and people give clues to try and signify something to others. There is a strange relationship because others can see you more easily than you can see yourself.

They also define the moment, and people who give a first impression give a lasting impression. Sometimes actions are different from first impressions, and then things start to break down.

>In s t r e s s in g the fact that the initial definition of the situation
projected by an individual ten d s to provide a plan for the
co-operative activity that follows—in st r e s s in g th is a c tion point
o f view—we must not overlook the crucial fact that any proje
c te d definition of the s ituation a lso h a s a d is t in c t iv e moral
character. It i s th is moral cha racter of projections tha t will
chiefly concern us in th is report. Society is organized on the
principle that any individual who p o s s e s s e s certain soc ia l
ch a r a c te r i s t ic s has a moral right to expe ct that othe rs will
value and treat him in a correspondingly appropriate way.
Connected with th is principle is a second, namely tha t an individual
who implicitly.or explicitly s ig n i f ie s that he has certain
so c ia l ch a r a c te r i s t ic s ought to have this claim honoured by
others and ought in fact to be what he claims he is. In consequence, when an individual projects a definition of the situation
and thereby makes an implicit or explicit claim to be a
person of a particular kind, he automatically exerts a moral
demand upon the others, obliging them to value and treat him in
the manner that p e r sons of h is kind have a right to expect. He
also implicitly forgoes all claims to be things he does not
appear to be p.6

Definitional disruptions are guarded against, but also play a role in, humor for instance, or other parts of everyday life. The funny stories when people messed up, acted out of character.

When an individual appears before others, he has motives to control the impression of him and hte situation. There are common techniques people use to make sense of this.

Some definitions:
<def>Interaction: all the interaction which occurs throughout one occasion when a given set of individuals are in one another's continuous presentce.</def>
<def>performance: all the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the other participants. People who watch these performances are the audience, observers, or co-participants. Different people may have different parts or routines in a performance. </def>
<def>social role: the enactment of rights and duties attached to a given status, involving one or more parts</def>

## Performances

Sometimes people perform for the benefit of other people. There is some variation to the extent to which some "true self" is part of the performance.

>At one extreme, ■ we find that the performer can be fully
taken in by h is own a c t ; he can be sinc erely convinced that the
impression of rea lity which he s ta g e s i s the real reality. When
h is audienc e i s a l so convinced in th is way about the show he
pu ts o n—and th i s se ems to be the typical c a s e —then for the
moment, anyway, only the soc iologis t or the so c ia l ly disgruntled
will have any doubts about the ' r e a l n e s s ’ of what i s
presented. p. 10

People may also think the routine is total bullshit. People may think they are deluding their audience.

That is, there is some inward belief in the role one plays.
<def>front: the part of the individual's perfromance which regularly functions in a general and fixed fashion to define the situation for those who observe the perfromance. The front is the expressive equipment of a performance</def>

Parts of a front:
1. Setting, physical
2. Personal front - the physical characteristics of the individual, what they look like and what they wear.
2a. appearance -clothes/etc.
2b. manner  - how they act

WE expect some coherence between these things. When actors take on a role, the front is usually already set for them. There are some types of things that are appropriate for the actor in the role.

### Dramatic Realizations
Signs highlight specific things. Individuals mobilize activity that expresses meaning during the interaction. An umpire does things quickly to seem sure of his judgement, for example. You also, for instance, must charge high prices for things that seem like they're expensive.

People want to show themselves in their sphere more than in other spheres. A CEO may not care if he is heard in the grocery store but cares very much in the boardroom (to solidify his role)

### Idealization

One must be socizlised to understand how society is presented. The impressions that performers give are idealized.

People will act in ways that are socially accepted when others are watching. You may even highlight that you are doing something good to others so that they focus on it. People have all sorts of displays of modesty, etc.

Poeple have secret pleasures, or hopes to conceal profit from others. Sometimes the work that went into something (either a lot or a little) is concealed.

People conceal things that are incompatible with an idealized version of themselves and their products. He also wants the audience to believe that he is related to them in a positive/ideal way.

### Maintenance of Expressive Control

Audiences accept minor cues from individuals. Individuals control the expressions they make, the cues they give off, to some extent. But they do these things in a way that does not seem odd, is not so obvious.

Unmeant gestures occure widely and convey disparate impressions. There are three types:
1. A performer accidentaly conveys incapacity, imporpriety, by losing muscular control - yawning, belching, tripping, etc.
2. A performer accidentally seems too much or too little concerned with the interaction. Appear nervous, self conscious, laugh, etc.
3. Inadequate direction - the setting is wrong, the performance isn't right, there are unseen contingencies.

It shows that we have social roles but we are also humans.

>As human beings we are
presumably c re a tu re s of variable impulse with moods and
ene rgie s tha t change from one moment to the next. As
ch a ra c te r s put on for an audience, however, we must not be
su b je c t to ups and downs. As Durkheim suggested, we <lo
not allow our higher soc ial activity ‘ to follow in the trail
of our bodily s ta te s , a s our s e n s a t io n s and our general bodily
c o n s c io u sn e s s do.1 1 A certain bureaucratization of the
spir it i s expe cted so that we can be relied upon to give a
perfectly homogeneous performance at every appointed time. p. 36

### Misrepresentation

Signs can be misunderstood. WE can intentionally misrepresent ourselves. Sometimes it is unclear to what extent someone is impersonating something else, and whether or not this is OK. For instance, if you claim to love music! FOr example, there is shading between lies and truth.

### Mystificiation


There is a leap here between Schutz/Berger Luckmann to Goffman - The development of belief systems - of values, of appropriateness etc..

# Teams

REmember that performances happen often in teams. People are often forced to act with respect to a certain task at hand. This is what happens at work. Up until now we considered the following:
1. Individual Performance
2. Others as a whole

But we have to think about cooperative performances as well. We can think of teams of performers working together.

The team is a particular type of collective grouping.
1. Any member can give the show away .
2. A front cannot be maintained between individuals in the performance since they are actively cooperating in producing the front towards others.
3. May be bound together formally or informal.

There must be some unanimous agreement outwardly projected to keep a team performing in a specific way. ONe must maintain some party line. Control of the setting helps the line be maintained.

IN teams, two functions must be fulfilled:
1. Someone must bring team members back into line.
2. Someone must allocate parts of the performance.

Someone may take the lead and so there are a few types of team dominance:
1. Directive dominance - described above
2. Dramatic Dominance - Taking the lead on a team.
3. Appearance People? - SOme people appear more than others, some are more behind the scenes. Ceremonial dominance perhaps.

>A team is a
grouping, but it i s a grouping not in relation to a social
structure or social organization but rather in relation to an
interaction or se r ie s of interactions in which the relevant
definition of the situation is maintained. p.64


# Regions and Region Behavior

Different standards exist in different regions. Southern charm, for instance. Manner will change, different things will be polite. And at work, for instance, some things are considered necessary, i.e. to seem busy. People may also need certain spaces to hide certain emotions. People want to go backstage and act differently. This is called "region difficulty"

For example, work and recreation regions. There are different styles in the different regions and there is some contention about how much to let on about some other region.

>A final point must be sugge s ted about backstage relationships
. When we say that persons who co-operate in presenting
a performance may ex p re s s familiarity with one another when
not in the presence of the audience, it must be allowed that
one can become so habituated to one’s front region activity
and front region cha racter that it may be n e c e s sa ry to handle
o n e ’s relaxation from it as a performance. One may feel
obliged, when backstage, to act out of cha racter in a familiar
fashion and this can come to be more of a pose than the
performance for which it was meant to provide a relaxation. p.82

# Discrepant Roles

Teams must be able to keep secrets of different kinds, dark, light, inside, etc. Some secrets may be entrusted or more freely available.

What are discrepant roles? Those that bring someone into a false guise. An informer, someone who pretneds  to be on a team and then shares the information with others. There are also people who pretend to be audience members but are also performers.

Another discrepant role might be a mediator. The foreman is a pretty interesting mediator.

A bigge one is that of the non-person. They play a role but are not in ther interaction at all. The servant, for instance.

Some other roles are specialist, confidant, and colleague and maybe renegade.


# Communication out of Character
THere are less apparent communications out of character that give those in the know cues about how htey really feel.

>They demonstrate that while a
performer may act a s i f h i s response in a situation were
immediate, unthinking, and spontaneous, and while he himself
may think th is to be the c a s e , still it will always be pos s ible
for s itu a tio n s to a r is e in which he will convey to one or two
persons pre sent the understanding that the show he is maintaining
i s only and merely a show

They may do the exact opposite of what they're supposed to do on stage, like talking about the customers they have to be nice to. People also give cues to each other secretly about what hteir supposed to do without an audience ncessarily noticing. Peole do something later to realign their actions with their beliefs .

# Impression Management.

Really we have been talking about impression management all along. Performances might be disrupted, or things might become so intense that there are incidents

People try to stop incidents from occuring by doing some kind of impression management.
Teams may try to stop incidents/disloyalty by creating high sanctions.
