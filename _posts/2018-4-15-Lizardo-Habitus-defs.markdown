People often think of Bourdieu without going too deeply into thinking about how habitus functions. In this way we think of Bourdieu primarily as a theorist of class. But we must remember that in addition to fields and forms of capital habitus is a big part of what's going on.

The habitus allows bourdieu to analyze social agents as embodied actors.

Bourdieu's notion of habitus is a cognitive sociology.

## Unpackign the Habitus

What is habitus? It is a theory of individual action. It is, for instance, a system of lasting, transposable dispositions which integrate past expereicnces and works as a matrix of perceptions, appreciations and actions.

The idea is that haitus is a perceptual and classifying structure, and as a generative structure of practical actions.

In a sense , TO ADAM, it feels like the habitus is really a combination of two parts of cognitive theory - perception and strategy of action. But this is relaly where we miss out right, in a discussion of action as such? This is the problem of cognitive sociology.


WE realize that habitus is a system of categories, but also ones that make specific actions possible.

>For Bourdieu, a proper account of practice was not possible without paying
attention to the very way in which practice was produced through structure and
how the
habitus
could take the products of practical action in its recursive attempt
to reproduce larger structures. Therefore, Bourdieu’s thinking is not marked with
an inherent tension between “acceptable” practice-theoretical formulations of
action versus an “unacceptable” view of the objectivism of structure. p.56

In essence, the habitus is a pscychological structure that mirrrors to some extent the social structure.
>he intersection of field and internalized
dispositions in habitus is in fact the meeting point of two ontologically distinct but
mutually constitutive structural orders (objective and internalized) and not the point at
which “agency” meets structure. p.7

Where does habitus come from?

# Piaget's Genetic Epistemology

There is, for piaget, an analogical transfer of schemes that provides solutions to similarly shaped problems.

>He was also one of the few
scholars that rejected the static understanding of structuralism inherited from
Saussure and adopted almost wholesale by Levi-Strauss and who preferred
instead a notion of structuralism that conceptualized structures as fluid and
unpredictable, with a determined sequential origin (hence the appellate—favored
by Bourdieu—of genetic) and subject to specifiable conditions that facilitated change
and development (Dosse, 1997: p. 175; Piaget, 1977).9 In fact Piaget’s notorious
dismissal of Chomskyan nativism centered precisely on Chomsky’s inattention to
the genesis of linguistic structure and his abandonment of the question of genesis
to biology and neurophysiology p. 8

Structures as fluid and unpredictable, with a sequential origin in the mind.

For piaget knwledge is social, practical and grounded in action. We are alla bout getting action.

>Schemas are much
more useful for the organism than purely sensory stimuli due to the fact that the
latter are fleeting and can only survive in a sensory memory system for a relatively
short amount of time. Schemata on the other hand, can be temporarily held in a
more reliable working memory system, were they can be ultimately transferred to
a long term memory store. Schemata are also convenient in that they are more
malleable and flexible than purely sensory stimuli. Finally the organism responds
with an action sequence in order to either transform or respond to the environmental
representations constructed from the sensory stimulation. The entire perception-
processing-action-generation sequence is thus covered under the term
cognitive, not only the symbol-manipulation stage p. 9

Piaget broke down action schemes and logical structures. aAction schemes are bodily knowledge, logical structures are ways of thinking. Bourdieu collapsed these.

Piaget discussed new processes being pushed through the same action scheme as assimilation.

>I submit that the idea of habitus as a lasting system of transposable dispositions
that provides a generative matrix of classificatory and practical competences and
automatisms cannot be understood apart from the generalized idea of cognitive
operations. p.14

>how can the body “generalize” when generalization is the prototypical “cognitive”
operation, and thus purely conceptual and occurring “inside the head”?
This is where familiarity with the Piagetian corpus, helps makes sense of certain
claims made by Bourdieu, especially in the more “conceptual” sections of The
Logic of Practice. For Bourdieu, the purely symbolic analysis of myth, stories and
other linguistic phenomena, especially that which concentrates in purely semantic
resemblances, and metaphoric oppositions deployed in ritual practice, or the
“. . . language of overall resemblance and uncertain abstraction” is still “too intellectualist
to be able to express a logic that is performed directly in bodily gymnastics”
(emphasis added). Thus the “practical schemes” by “inducing and identity of
reaction in a diversity of situations” and “impressing the same posture on the
body in different contexts”, “can produce the equivalent of an act of generalization
that cannot be accounted for without recourse to concepts.” p.16
