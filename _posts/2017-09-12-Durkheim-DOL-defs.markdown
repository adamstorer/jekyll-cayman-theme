Previous Notes on Division of Labor:
Durkheim has deductive steps, works deductively, we ar etracing his deductive steps

A good theory lays out the assumptions and is consistent about the assumptions they make

1. Introduction to Durkheim
Academic, not engaged in the political work,d is concerned improving society
Is the creator of sociology, puts sociology on the map
Durkheim is consensus instead of conflict, but this book is focused on the concept of solidarity
Struggles for socialism, a symptom of the disease of society, tells us about the sickness of society
2. Sociology as a Science
sociologists as a study of morality (xxv)
studies how different societies have different moralities. moral facts are phenomenon like any others
a moral fact is something that we all feel obligated to follow, that we ought to follow, implying some idea of “oughtness” or “rightness”
a moral fact is based on the collective consciousness, consciousness affects all, the extent to which it invades individuals, and most people internalize them
simple minded notion of internalization, no talk of contradictory rules
study how different societies adopt different moralities, have different moral rules,
     SCIENCE
Science xvi “we shall demonstrate in it how science can help in finding the direction in which our conduct ought to go.” By understanding morality, we can understand the moral ideal
Marx is not science because there is no real study of current society, just makes up communism. Marx distills communism from within capitalism
real difference in beliefs about the division of labor between Durkheim and Marx
Try to look at the world and see where the world is going
can use this to deduce what is a healthy society

3. Method in the Book
the idea of the division of labor is subject to a lot of controversy, raging debates of whether we should be specialized experts or not
how do we go about this scientifically
observe something that is morally unquestionable (p.6)
solidarity is the one thing that is so truly morally unquestionable. solidarity is the feelings of oneness of others. THIS IS AN ASSUMPTION.
can we all agree that solidarity is good?
what is the relationship between the division of labor and solidarity? there is two types of solidarity
mechanical solidarity - solidarity based on similarity, we love one another because we’re all the same
organic similarity - solidarity based on complimentary differences
example - men and women. women’s brains get smaller because of the differences in the division of labor, so women’s brains become smaller because of the division of labor. men’s brains become bigger. (THERE IS A MORALITY UNDER ORGANIC SOLIDARITY), but the cause of the brain size. the division of labor brings us together because of our complimentary differences. insofar as the division of labor produces solidarity, it is something good. does it actually produce solidarity.
     how to find out if organic solidarity? find out something that you can measure. you can’t measure solidarity, you find something you can measure! by looking at laws, using a proxy, you can finally say something about solidarity. different solidarities are different laws
the law that has mechanical solidarity has penal law, organic solidarity has restitutive law (brings things back to what it does before)
more interaction, more solidarity, more laws. for marx, you organize domination, containing struggle, for durkheim  laws represent the solidarity (ASSUMPTION)
in mechanical solidarity, there are no individual differences or consciousness, there is a collective consciousness only. as the division of labor develops, repressive law decreases and constitutive law increases
as the division of labor increases the amount of solidarity diminishes historically, but these are abnormal forms where division of labor reduces the amount of, because there is organic solidarity


4. Mechanical Solidarity     
Crime - an act of (38-9) dissension against the collective consciousness
collective consciousness- "totality of beliefs and sentimentss common to the average members of a society forms a determinate system with a life of its own
something that’s bad in itself is commonly thought of as a crime, but this is not necessarily the case
the significance of a crime is that it is punished because condemn. punishmentt repairs the identity of the collective consciousness
punishment has to be public to work, passionate begins everyone has to believes its right. we are committed to it emotionally. also it’s organized. collective consciousness might atrophy if there is no punishment, if there is no crime
The State - the 42-3, it embodies the collective consciousness, expresses it, and symbolizes it. An offense against the state is punished because it is an expression against the collective consciousness.
the state is also autonomous, capable of creating its own addiction. thus it wards off hostile force, a governing authority categorizes it as crimes even when the sentiments of the collectivity aren’t existed. the state decides what is a crime and what isn’t a crime, generates a classification of behaviors and activities and giving them moral valence.
the power of this chapter is that the state defines what deviant behavior is
marx would say that the state is illusory general interest

Durkheim is saying there is some role that can be played by ‘contractual solidarity,’ in which you have basically just a free market, because in every contract there is agreement among members around some form of right and wrong, and you have to think that this is right from all vantage points. “For such a contract to be feasible, at any given time all individual wills hosuld be in agreement regarding the common foundations of social organization and consequently every individual consciousness should pose to itself the political problem in all its generality. But in order to have a sort of social contract and the rousseauean form, where there is total unanimous agreement among all parties, there can’t be division of labor because that would engender disagreement.

For me there is perhaps some conflation of the idea of a contract here, which is allowing one to connect contractual law to rousseau’s social contract. But i think this is kind of the point or th innovation that spencer is trying to put forward

>p.152 “Society would be no more than the establishment of relationships between individuals exchanging the products of their labour, and without any social action, properly so termed, intervening to regulate that exchange.” This is a reply to the Marxist formulation of modern society, and Durkheim agrees that this formulation would logically end in despair for all. However! We see that societies do not actually develop in this way, because as societies become more advanced, their legal code grows in size (p.153)

At the same time, we see at the same time as the division of labor, a real change occurs in the “social control over the way in which obligations are entered into and dissolved is modified, and continually increasing.” p.158 this is because everything that was once segmentary is now becoming reliant on each other, and thus part of one larger social system. As contracts between individuals increase, there is also “obligation that has not been agreed by both sides [that is] in not any way contractual.”

p.160 “We must not forget that thif the division of labor joins interests solidly together, it does not mix them together: it leaves them distinct, and in competition with one another. The point of contractual law, therefore is to foresee “what we could not do individually; what we could not regulate is regulated, and this regulation is mandatory upon us, although it is not our handiwork, but that of society and tradition.” So contractual law “is no longer a useful supplement to individual agreements, but their basic norm”

In contracts, there is also a moral code. p.162 “we are forced to conform to rules which, although not sanctioned, either directly or indirectly, by any legal code, are none the less mandatory.” These morals are an inherently social fact.

p.163 contracts cannot be the only regulating part of society, because there is often disproportionality in the gain of a contract “and this disproportionality is often glaring. Yet — and this is the retort of a whole school of thought — if the gains are too low, the function will be abandndoned for other functions…They forget that a whole section of the population cannot abandon their function in this way, since no other is available to them.”

p.172 a set of propositions
1. social life is derived from a dual source, the similarity of individual consciousnesses and the social division of labor.
2. The similarity of consciousnesses gives rise to legal rules which imp use upon everybody uniform beliefs and practices. As individual consciousnesses become more similar, they represent religious uniformity and communism
3. Divion of labor gives rise to rules that set out how things should be, restitutory laws as opposed to expiatory.
4. There is also a moral side of rules. Many penal laws means morality is extensive. Where restitutory law is developed, there are different professional moralities, where workers have their own public opinions delimited through specific bodies. Here there are also rules which are not legal, but which you are morally required to comply with. However, all these rules are essentially social in nature, and are differences in degree, not in category.
5. So altruism, us complying with these rules, is the basis of societ

ch.7 - foundation of economic sociology and of talcott parsons works.

Summary
1.  IS DOL a moral rule/fact? is it something we should support or oppose - this is what durkheim wants to answer scientifically
2. Does DoL contribute to something of unambiguous moral worth? Solidarity?
3. Two types of solidarity, likenesses and complimentary differences
4. Solidarity is something you can’t directly measure - measuring it through laws? if there’s a lot of solidarity there’s a lot of interaction, if there’s a lot of interaction, there’s a lot of regulation, if there’s a lot of regulation, there’s a lot of laws! Two types of law - Repressive law that repairs the collective consciousness, restitutory law repairs/restores the relations impaired.
5. As the DL increases, and Solidarity increases, restitutive law should increase. DL produces solidarity
6. If, however, it turns out the DoL increases solidarity, but also there is more conflict, then your division of labor is in an abnormal form.
7. Do the abnormal forms must somehow tend towards the normal? And if so, why, how, under what conditions

Two Types of Solidarity
Mechanical Solidarity - Strong collective consciousness in which the individual consciousness disappears and we all share common sentiments that are intensely felt. This is similar to repressive law
Organic Solidarity - Based on interdependence, but this interdependence requires regulation, taking the form of restitutive law, defines the division of labor, and defines when relationships of the division of labor should be repaired. the sanction is not punishment but to return the stutation to the status quo. Domestic Law, Contractual Law, Procedural Law, Constitutional Law, administrative law
(Property Law does not enjoin individuals, it is about a person and a thing, not the relations of people)
     - There are two meanings of the division of labor, the one between parts of society and one between individuals
     - Thinking about divorce law and how it changes from

Mechanical Solidarity - Like a rock, all the same (Collective Consciousness is much more important than Individual Consciousness), repressive law, punishment that is public passionate and organized
Organic Solidarity - Like an organism, everything works together, there’s an interdependence so that Individual Consciousness grows much more than collective consciousness. restitutive law, sanctions restore status quo/relations

Durkheims Review of Spencer
Contractual Society - Non-contracutal elements of contract, you can’t lay out all the aspects of social life like trust and common values that are taken for granted, and these are SOCIAL, contracts only work with respect to the social. There are also professional morality

People should have capacity to have equal capacity to withdraw from the contract, equal power.  You need social justice as regulated by the sate

There are also non-contractual spheres of society such as the family

Spencer
Contractual Society - A society of people entering into contracts a market society
Spantaneous Solidarity
State Withers Away


Collective Consciousness under Organic Solidarity:

1. Weaker and Vaguer as a whole
2. Cult of the Individual
3. Social Justice becomes an element
4. Morality of Cooperation (174)

But what is the relationship between the collective consciousness and the division of labor? we don’t know exactly in tho particular formulation, wait for book 3!

Book II, chapter 2 (OLD: pp.200-25; NEW: pp.201-222)
Book III, chapters 1,2 & 3 (OLD: 291-328; NEW: 277-308)
Conclusion (OLD: pp.329-41; NEW: 309-319)
Preface to Second Edition (OLD: pp.xxxi-lix; NEW: pp.8-32)

p.212 “A break in the equilibrium of the social mass gives rise to conflicts that can only be resolved by a more developed form of the division of labor”

The division of labor is a kind of social darwinism, but with the benefit that when you win at competition, the other person isn’t killed!

As division of labor happens, p. 213 “It may happen that an organism attains an abnormal level of activity that is out of all proportion to the need, and, to meet the expense occasioned by this exaggerated development, it must take way from the share of others…They are due to the fact that the nourishment of the organism does not take place regularly or the fact that the functional equilibrium is broken.”

Where does the demand for a better society, demand for change from an unsatisfactory equilibrium, come from? p. 214 “Progress is due to the greater fierceness of struggle…In order for life to continue the reward must always be proportionate to the effort” In other words, as the division of labor becomes moe distinct peope’s brains become smarter and it makes them want more stuff. There is also a vaguely articulated necessity for shared values on p.216

There can only really be conflict when there is society. p.217 “Since competition cannot have determined their coming together, it must indeed have already pre-existed. The individuals between whom the conflict is joined must already be solidly linked to one another and feel so, that is, they belong to the same society.”3

j””as theorganised type of society develops the fusion of the various segments entails the fusion of the markets into one single market, which embraces almost all of society.” p.305

what resolves the contradiction between the individualization of  the division of labor that separates everyone from each othe rid that p.307 “what resolves this contradiction is the fact that, contrary to what has been said, the division of labour does not produces these consequences through some imperative of its own nature, but only in exceptional and abnormal circumstances.” p.308 “The division of labour supposes that the worker, far from remaining bent over his task, does not lose sight of those cooperating with him, but acts upon them and is acted upon by them.” He has to understand there’s a goal somewhere.

CH 2

p.311 We might be set to work on something which is not actually what we’re suited for. in this case “for the division of labor to engender solidarity, it is thus not sufficient for everyone to have his task: it must also be agreeable to him.” ***do we believe in the inherent agreeability of a task? it seems like he was just working against that in the last section, where a task becomes agreeable when you understand what you’re working towards.”

p.312 “Normally a man finds happiness in fulfilling his nature; his needs are proportionate to his means. Thus in the organism each organ claims only that quantity of food consisten with tis position.”

The Second Morbid Type: THE FORCED DIVISION OF LABOR

There is something called perfect spontaneity, when the division of labor naturally is split up based on people’s abilities


p.315 Why there is no change
“The dissatisfaction raisin from thwarted aspiration is not sufficient to turn those who scuffer from it against the social order that is its cause, for they continue to adhere to it. This is not because they find in it the necessary file for the development of their professional activity, but because it epitomizes in their eyes a host of beliefs and practices by which they live They cling to it because the whole of their inner life is bound up with it”

But societies must work towards ending incorrect differentiation not matching needs and abilities because p.316 “in solving this problem their very existence is at stake. For they cannot continue to be sustained unless al their constituent parts are solidly linked, and solidarity is only possible on this condition.”

p.316 Essentailly, 9once total fairness and equality is created, the contract is king again, it brings people together in a higher way for high er societies. all we have to do is make sure that we are freely exchanging contracts based on social value

p.322 “Just as ancient peoples had above all needs of a common faith to live by we have need of justice. We can rest assured that this need will become ever more pressing if, as everything leads us to foresee, the conditions that dominate social evolution remain unchanged.” This is

ch.3

What about when there is a waste of effort? The group isn’t working correctly, because the regulatory body  isn’t working correctly. p.323 “For the evil to vanish it does not therefore suffice to have some kind of regulatory mechanism; it needs to be exercised in a certain way…The prime task of an intelligent and experienced leader will be to abolish useless jobs and distribute work in such a way that each individual will be kept sufficiently busy, thus increasing the functional activity of every worker. Then order will spontaneously arise once more, at the same time as the work is more economically arranged.”

p.324 “Solidarity in general depends very closely upon the functional activity of the specialized parts.” i.e. society isn’t working if people are doing bullshit woe
