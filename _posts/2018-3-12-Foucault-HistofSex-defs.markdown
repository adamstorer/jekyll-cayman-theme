People used to talk freely about sex but then the Victorian bourgeoisie carefully confined sex to the home, disallowing people and children from ever talking about it. By not talking about it, you make it not real.

One can easily argue that capitalism is a part of this -
>if sex is so rigorously repressed, this is because it is
incompatible with a general and intensive work imperative. p.6

But this is BAD sociology. But we so often think of sex repression.

>If sex is repressed, that is, condemned to
prohibition, nonexistence, and silence, then the mere fact
that one is speaking about it has the appearance of a deliberate
transgression. A person who holds forth in such language
places himself to a certain extent outside the reach of power;
he upsets established law; he somehow anticipates the coming
freedom. This explains the solemnity with which one
speaks of sex nowadays p.6


>Briefly, my aim is
to examine the case of a society which has been loudly castigating
itself for its hypocrisy for more than a century, which
speaks verbosely of its own silence, takes great pains to relate
in detail the things it does not say, denounces the powers it
exercises, and promises to liberate itself from the very laws
that have made it function. I would like to explore not only
these discourses but also the will that sustains them and the
strategic intention that supports them. The question I would
like to pose is not, Why are we repressed? but rather, Why
do we say, with so much passion and so much resentment
against our most recent past, against our present, and against
ourselves, that we are repressed? By what spiral did we come
to affirm that sex is negated? p.8-9

Three doubts regarding the repressive hypothesis.
1. Is sexual repression truly an established historical fact?
2. Do the workings of power really belong primarily to the category of repression?
3. Did the critical discourse that addresses itself to repression come to act as a roadblock to a power mechanism that had operated unchallenged up to that point? Or is it not in fact part of the same historical network as the thing it denounces by calling it repression?

Foucault wishes to move beyond a repressive hypothesis.

# The Repressive Hypothesis
## Incitement to Discourse
It seems there has been an explosion of discourse - the authorized vocabulary became new but there still was one. There was policing of statements and enunciation - there was definitely restriction.

However, talking about sex in terms of science was more of a thing. Not indecent speech, but new ways of talking about sex.
>According to the new
pastoral, sex must not be named imprudently, but its aspects,
its correlations, and its effects must be pursued down to their
slenderest ramifications: a shadow in a daydream, an image
too slowly dispelled, a badly exorcised complicity between
the body's mechanics and the mind's complacency: everything
had to be told. A twofold evolution tended to make the
flesh into the root of all evil, shifting the most important
moment of transgression from the act itself to the stirrings of desire. p.19-20

That is, there is kind of an obvious, clear, science-likek discussion of sex.

OF the author of books about his sexual exploits:
>I am inclined to think that, in an
epoch dominated by (highly prolix) directives enjoining discretion
and modesty, he was the most direct and in a way the
most naive representative of a plurisecular injunction to talk
about sex. p. 22

>This is the essential
thing: that Western man has been drawn for three centuries
to the task of telling everything concerning his sex; that since
the classical age there has been a constant optimization and
an increasing valorization of the discourse on sex; and that
this carefully analytical discourse was meant to yield multiple
effects of displacement, intensification, reorientation, and
modification of desire itself. Not only were the boundaries of
what one could say about sex enlarged, and men compelled
to hear it said; but more important, discourse was connected
to sex by a complex organization with varying effects, by a
deployment that cannot be adequately explained merely by
referring it to a law of prohibition.p. 23

It seemed as though one had to speak of sex apart from the moralism, something not to be condemned but MANAGED, regulated for the greater good, made to function according to an optimum.

Sex was policed in the same way as in discipline and punish, through a kind of collective/individual discourse.

For instance, the government working on population had to think very seriously about sex.
In schools, people thought about sex a lot - in the architecture, in the rules, and the internal organization.

Some even taught sex very matter of factly, making their frank and scientific talk seem lewd to their parents.

That is, we are dealing with a multiplicity of sexual discourses with a whole series of mechanisms operating in different institutions.

## The Perverse Implantation
>A possible objection: it would be a mistake to see in this
proliferation of discourses merely a quantitative phe}1omenon,
something like a pure increase, as if what was said in
them were immaterial, as if the fact of speaking about sex
were of itself more important than the forms of imperatives
that were imposed on it by speaking about it. p. 36

That is, didn't they really have the same things in mind - that is, a sexuality that is economically useful and politically conservative.

If this is the objective, then reduction of overall speech has not been the way that people get there.

Three laws - canonical law, christian pastoral, and civil law - guided thought about what was licit and illicit regarding sexual practices.

More discourses meant that the practices and pleasures were kept quiet as a strict norm, but the sexuality of deviants and children was discussed in greater detial thna before.

>Similarly, in the civil order, the
confused category of "debauchery," which for more than a
century had been one of the most frequent reasons for administrative
confinement, came apart. From the debris, there
appeared on the one hand infractions against the legislation
(or morality) pertaining to marriage and the family, and on
the other, offenses against the regularity of a natural function p.39

Why did we name all of the things that werent allowed?
>When this whole thicket of disparate sexualities
was labeled, as if to disentangle them from one another, was
the object to exclude them from reality? It appears, in fact,
that the function of the power exerted in this instance was
not that of interdiction, and that it involved four operations
quite different from simple prohibition. p.41

1. Think of adultery vs child sexuality. One is meant to decrease the thing that is condemned, while the second is meant to both bolster the power of those who are stopping infant sexuality as well as enact onto the object. That is, we try to bar certain actions, but we also try to penetrate the individual?
2. One must incorporate perversions together and create new individuals. Think of sodomy as a forbidden act vs a homosexual. With the homosexual, nothing went into his personality taht was not related to the act of sodomy.
>Homosexuality appeared
as one of the forms of sexuality when it was transposed
from the practice of sodomy onto a kind of interior
androgyny, a hermaphrodism of the soul. The sodomite had
been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a
species. p. 43

That is, we see not the exclusion of an act but the creation of a type - this is a new form of power/discipline.

3. The specification of things to a greater extent demanded constant and curious presence.
>the oddities
of sex relied on a technology of health and pathology.
And conversely, since sexuality was a medical and medicalizable
object, one had to try and detect it-as a lesion, a
dysfunction, or a symptom-in the depths of the organism,
or on the surface of the skin, or among all the signs of
behavior p. 44

>The medical examination, the psychiatric inves.!igation,
the pedagogical report, and family controls may have the
over-all and apparent objective of saying no to all wayward
or unproductive sexualities, but the fact is that they function
as mechanisms with a double impetus: pleasure and power.
The pleasure that comes of exercising a power that questions,
monitors, watches, spies, searches out, palpates, brings to
light; and on the other hand, the pleasure that kindles at
having to evade this power, flee from it, fool it, or travesty
it. The power that lets itself be invaded by the pleasure it is
pursuing; and opposite it, power asserting itself in the pleasure
of showing off, scandalizing, or resisting. p. 45

4. What about the devices of sexual saturation? There is a real proliferation here.
>People often say that modern society has attempted
to reduce sexuality to the couple-the heterosexual and, insofar
as possible, legitimate couple. There are equal grounds
for saying that it has, if not created, at least outfitted and
made to proliferate, groups with multiple elements and a
circulating sexuality: a distribution of points of power, hierarc
hi zed and placed opposite to one another p. 45


>In actual fact. The manifold sexualities-those which appear
with the different ages (sexualities of the infant or the
child), those which become fixated on particular tastes or
practices (the sexuality of the invert, the gerontophile, the
fetishist), those which, in a diffuse manner, invest relationships
(the sexuality of doctor and patient, teacher and student,
psychiatrist and mental patient), those which haunt
spaces (the sexuality of the home, the school, the prison)all
form the correlate of exact procedures of power. We must
not imagine that all these things that were formerly tolerated
attracted notice and received a pejorative designation when
the time came to give a regulative role to the one type of
sexuality that was capable of reproducing labor power and
the form of the family. These polymorphous conducts were
actually extracted from people's bodies and from their pleasures;
or rather, they were solidified in them; they were drawn
out, revealed, isolated, intensified, incorporated, by multifarious
power devices. The growth of perversions is not a
moralizing theme that obssessed the scrupulous minds of the
Victorians. It is the real product of the encroachment of a
type of power on bodies and their pleasures. p47-48


>We have not only witnessed a visible exp1osion of
unorthodox sexualities; but-and this is the important point
-a deployment quite different from the law, even if it is
locally dependent on procedures of prohibition, has ensured,
through a network of interconnecting mechanisms, the proliferation
of specific pleasures and the multiplication of disparate
sexualitie p. 49

# Scientia Sexualis

It may still seem taht even if this does somehow create a kind of sexual mosaic, it is only in defense. But what about the scientific aspect? Teh biological aspect?

People only talk about sex through erotic art or science (historically

  >On the face of it at least, our civilization possesses no ars
erotica. In return, it is undoubtedly the only civilization to
practice a scientia sexualis; or rather, the only civilization to
have developed over the centuries procedures for telling the
truth of sex which are geared to a form of knowledge-power
strictly opposed to the art of initiations and the masterful
secret: I have in mind the confession) p.58

And from confession you get therapy, moving from sin to science.


>Let us put forward a general working hypothesis. The
society that emerged in the nineteenth century-bourgeois,
capitalist, or industrial society, call it what you will-did not
confront sex with a fundamental refusal of recognition. On
the contrary, it put into operation an entire machinery for
producing true discourses concerning it. Not only did it
speak of sex and compel everyone to do so; it also set out to
formulate the uniform truth of sex. As if it suspected sex of
harboring a fundamental secret. As if it needed this production
of truth. As if it was essential that sex be inscribed not
only in an economy of pleasure but in an ordered system of
knowledge. Thus sex gradually became an object of great
suspicion; the general and disquieting meaning that pervades
our conduct and our existence, in spite of ourselves; the point
of weakness where evil portents reach through to us; the
fragment of darkness that we each carry within us: a general
signification, a universal secret, an omnipresent cause, a fear
that never ends. And so, in this "question" of sex (in both
senses: as interrogation and problematization, and as the
need for confession and integration into a field of rationality),
two processes emerge, the one always conditioning the other:
we demand that sex speak the truth (but, since it is the secret
and is oblivious to its own nature, we reserve for ourselves
the function of telling the truth of its truth, revealed and
deciphered at last), and we demand that it tell us our truth,
or rather, the deeply buried truth of that truth about ourselves
which we think we possess in our immediate consciousness. p. 69

# The Deployment of Sexuality

It is easy to think of power as a limit on freedom, and power with regards to sex as stopping poeple from doing things. But this is only part of it.

>We
shall try to rid ourselves of a juridical and negative representation
of power, and cease to conceive of it in terms of law,
prohibition, liberty, and sovereignty. But how then do we
analyze what has occurred in recent history with regard to
this thing-seemingly one of the most forbidden areas of our
lives and bodies-that is sex? How, if not by way of prohibition
and blockage, does power gain access to it? Through
which mechanisms, or tactics, or devices? p.90

How to do this?

> It seems to me that power must be understood in the first
instance as the multiplicity of force relations immanent in the
sphere in which they operate and which constitute their own
organization; as the process which, through ceaseless struggles
and confrontations, transforms, strengthens, or reverses
them; as the support which these force relations find in one
another, thus forming a chain or a system, or on the contrary,
the disjunctions and contradictions which isolate them
from one another; and lastly, as the strategies in which they
take effect, whose general design or institutional crystallization
is embodied in the state apparatus, in the formulation
of the law, in the various social hegemonies.

Power comes from everywheere and is self-reproducing, not an institution or a structure, it is a complex strategical situation.

Bourdieu proposes some arguments:
* Power is not something acquired - it is exercised from innumerable points
* Relations of power are not in a position of exteriority to other relationships -they are the immediate effects of the divisions...Relations of power are not in superstructural positions, they have a directly productive role.
* Power comes from below, not only from above.
* Power relations are intentional and nonsubjective -
>there is no power that is exercised without a
series of aims and objectives. But this does not mean that
it results from the choice or decision of an individual
subject; let us not look for the headquarters that presides
over its rationality; neither the caste which governs, nor
the groups which control the state apparatus, nor those
who make the most important economic decisions direct
the entire network of power that functions in a society
(and makes it function); the rationality of power is characterized
by tactics that are often quite explicit at the restricted
level where they are inscribed (the local cynicism
of power), tactics which, becoming connected to one another,
attracting and propagating one another, but finding
their base of support and their condition elsewhere, end by
forming comprehensive systems: the logic is perfectly
clear, the aims decipherable, and yet it is often the case
that no one is there to have invented them, and few who
can be said to have formulated them: an implicit characteristic
of the great anonymous, almost unspoken strategies
which coordinate the loquacious tactics whose "inventors"
or decisionmakers are often without hypocrisy. p.95

* With power there is resistance, but there is no absolute outside where people come agains t powe.r There is no soul of revolt.
>Instead there
is a plurality of resistances, each of them a special case:
resistances that are possible, necessary, improbable; others
that are spontaneous, savage, solitary, concerted, rampant,
or violent; still others that are quick to compromise,
interested, or sacrificial; by definition, they can only exist
in the strategic field of power relations p.96

Foucault has some rules:
1. Rule of immanence - Things become of concern, and require the use of power, due to power, when the problem becomes immanent. There are local centers of knowledge and strategies of power that bring certain things to immanence.
2. Rules of continual variations - There is no onetime where things change, there are continual shifts and modifications.
3. Rule of double conditioning - There is no discontinuity if we think of effects and strategy - they both happen at the same time.
>rather, one must conceive of the double
conditioning of a strategy by the specificity of possible tactics,
and of tactics by the strategic envelope that makes them
work. Thus the father in the family is not the "representative"
of the sovereign or the state; and the latter are not
projections of the father on a different scale. The family does
not duplicate society, just as society does not imitate the
family. But the family organization, precisely to the extent
that it was insular and heteromorphous with respect to the
other power mechanisms, was used to support the great
"maneuvers" employed for the Malthusian control of the
birthrate, for the populationist incitements, for the medicalization
of sex and the psychiatrization of its non genital forms. p. 100

4. Tactical polyvalence of discourse - In discourse power and knowledge are tied together. So, discourse is a series of discontinuous segeents whose tactical function is neither uniform or stable.
>To be more precise, we must not
imagine a world of discourse divided between accepted discourse
and excluded discourse, or bet)Veen the dominant
discourse and the dominated one; but as a multiplicity of
discursive elements that can come into play in various strategies. p. 100

>In short, it is a question of orienting ourselves to a conception
of power which replaces the privilege of the law with the
viewpoint of the objective, the privilege of prohibition with
the viewpoint of tactical efficacy, the privilege of sovereignty
with the analysis of a multiple and mobile field of force
relations, wherein far-reaching, but never completely stable,
effects of domination are produced. The strategical model,
rather than the model based on law. And this, not out of a
speculative choice or theoretical preference, but because in
fact it is one of the essential traits of Western societies that
the force relationships which for a long time had found
expression in war, in every form of warfare, gradually became
invested in the order of political power. p.102

And basically in the life and death chapter, we return to a space where in the old days things were really about hard lines, taking life or letting live, and now we're more about fostering life or disallowing it. It is more pervasive, more about controlling people more braodly.

>One of these poles-the first to be
formed, it seems--centered on the body as a machine: its
disciplining, the optimization of its capabilities, the extortion
of its forces, the parallel increase of its usefulness and its
docility, its integration into systems of efficient and economic
controls, all this was ensured by the procedures of power that
characterized the disciplines: an anatomo-politics of the
human body. The second, formed somewhat later, focused
on the species body, the body imbued with the mechanics of
life and serving as the basis of the biological processes: propagation,
births and mortality, the level of health, life expectancy
and longevity, with all the conditions that can cause
these to vary. Their supervision was effected through an
entire series of interventions and regulatory controls: a biopolitics
of the population. The disciplines of the body and the
regulations of the population constituted the two poles
around which the organization of power over life was deployed. p.139
