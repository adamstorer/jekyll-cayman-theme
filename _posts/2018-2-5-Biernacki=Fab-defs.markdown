# Introduction

The question is - do internal differences in culture create and sustain decisive systematic divergences in practices? The question is posed particularly around factory work.

>I try to show that during the fateful transition to the new commercial
order, a different apparition of labor as a commodity took hold in each of the
leading economies of Western Europe. In each country a different solution
prevailed for determining just how the precious but subtle thing called labor
could be calibrated and transferred from hired hands to the employer in the
workshop. How could workers sell their ephemeral activity to an employer if
the realized output alone bore an exchangeable value? Just how should the
"quantity" of labor be measured? At what moment was the labor considered
to have been conferred upon the employer? British workers and employers
resolved these questions differently than did their German and French
counterparts. p.1

WE begin by looking at the shop floor. Textiles looked different in these different settings.

>I suggest that for each country, the schemas encoded in
silent practices within the private factory lent workers the concept of labor
they used to voice demands in the public sphere. p.3

>The work's range is broad but its analytic focus precise: it portrays
the development of manufacturing to shed light on the explanatory
significance of popular understandings of labor as a commodity. p.5

## Initial Test Cases

In Germany and England, wool porduction was the same. Also, in both countries firms were often under the ownership of family partners, and in many ways the production was the same.

How is culture a cause here?
>The logic of isolating an
important cultural cause of differences in outcomes by considering
alternative, economic sources of differentiation in no way implies that culture
serves only as a supplement for explaining what is left over. p.12

Previewed findings:
>reasoning specific to cultural analysis. Let me preview some findings
to illustrate. German owners and workers viewed employment as the timed
appropriation of workers' labor power and disposition over workers' labor
activity. In contrast, British owners and workers saw employment as the
appropriation of workers' materialized labor via its products. These divergent
assumptions led to differences in the definition of wages, the calculation of
costs, rights of employment, disciplinary fines, and the design of factory
buildings. Since the manufacturing practices in each country formed a
meaningful constellation, my positive argument is configurational, attached
to an overarching pattern of techniques p.12

## Culture in Labor HIstory

Looking at culture in labor is difficult. It starts with Making of the English Working Class
>Culture—in this instance primarily meaning the legacy of political ideas—
intervened to mediate workers' reactions to capitalist development.
Thompson's argument rested on circumscription: he showed that new
economic conditions, typified by the steam engine and textile mill, did not
suffice to explain the emergence of class consciousness. Having limited the
domain of economic explanation, he celebrated the mysterious
indeterminacy of human "agency," for he believed it sufficient for his
purpose that culture serve as an indispensable ingredient in workers'
responses. p.16

But can Culture be called upon at all?
>The issue is not
whether cultural components represent necessary ingredients, for almost
everything is worthy of that designation; it is, rather, whether cultural
elements have an independent and specifiable contribution apart from the
influence of other factors. Do they carry a strong, systematic effect which
justifies concentrating on them in their own right? p.17


It is hard to see how politics and economy can be distilled from culture. But markets themselves can be cultural projects.
>Reddy inadvertently offers a new cultural
teleology: employers acquire market categories through a learning process,
but in the end there is only one kind of market culture, and one definition of
labor as a commodity, which they are destined to adopt p.19

>In Reddy's narrative, "market
culture" germinates as an intellectual project but disseminates out of
practical necessity.[55] From this viewpoint it is all too easy to rest the case
for culture's importance upon the comfortable supposition that the most
general parameters of conduct are culturally fixed, allowing historical
narratives to present as adaptations to economic requirements the specific
design of the institutions of work. p.20

So what are possible theory influences?
1. Practice Theory - Bourdieu here. Bourdieu combines rational choice with cultural accounts. But Bourdieu also wants there to be something durably inculcated.  So there is no room for symbolic mediation of social conditions as agents acquire thier social skills. IN this way, the economy can be seen to have more of an effect while culture is everythingelse.
2. Taxonomies of Production - This is cultural structuralism. But we don't really see a cultural analysis of the production process.
>The proponents of this approach
share an emphasis on culture as a set of signs whose meanings are fixed
only differentially, that is, by their relations to all other signs in a
hypothesized system. Starting with the premise that meaning inheres in a
coherent, overarching structure of signs, these practitioners tend for the
sake of analysis to abstract culture from its contextual uses and to think of it
as a formal, systematically interrelated series of terms p. 25

>Although Sahlins's solution is inadequate for the capitalist
production process, he has correctly posed the challenge: the issue is not
whether culture represents a social force but whether it bears a constitutive
and identifiable logic of its own.[ p.28

WE can't use cultural structuralism because capitalism is too advanced. But there is something in the collective use of a cultural schema.

3. Practice and Subjective Meaning - For WEber there is some subjectivity in meaning making.
>Weber's own evidence
identifies a difficulty: an individual's interior assessment of the personally
most significant implication of economic practices does not specify with
precision how those practices should be outwardly organized. To distinguish
the causal influence of culture upon the form of the collective practices of
production, it is simpler and more effective to consider the publicly
discernible principles immediately organizing their execution. p. 32

Habermas is here too, where culture is the stock of knowledge from which participants in communication supply themselveswith interpreations as they come to an understanding abou something in the world.

However, it seems as though market and bureaucracy can take the place of communicativve action.

>The symbols
people use in their lifeworlds are subordinated to the functional requisites of
the marketplace or to other mechanisms for the impersonal exercise of
power. In this instance, cultural resources are constitutive of the lifeworld
only in the sense that they represent prerequisites on the level of
metatheory for the construction of social institutions; they no longer subject
the particular shape assumed by those institutions to a determinant cultural
logic p.34

Is this a real thing? To determine culture's effect? I am not sure that it is.

>My approach, which will unfold in the course of this historical study,
identifies culture in the order of practice at a single locus, the point of
production, not in practices reaching across many institutional domains and
not in an overarching world view encompassing social conduct at large. For,
in contrast to many other cultural studies, mine does not begin with the
philosophical premise that culture enabled people to create a meaningful
order. Rather than take such imputed mental processes for granted, I
proceed merely from a controlled comparison of outcomes: economic agents
in Germany and Britain constructed different techniques for carrying out the
same tasks of manufacture under similar business circumstances. p. 36

My question is, is the theory really different, or is it just the way taht you're using data that's different?


# Part 1 - The Cultural Structure of the Workplace
## Concepts and Practices of Labor
Whereas political economists thought of things in terms of relativeprice, Marx thought of things as labor power. Workers transfer labor and their own power to something else. Labor power unlocked "the secret of extraction of suprlus value under capitalism." p. 42 - But how did he get hterE?

Differences in the rates in the shop floor. WEavers got paid differently in British and German economies.

>As a tool for extracting labor from
weavers, the design of the scales would seem to depend only upon questions
of force and pragmatism: How much were employers ready to pay workers
for various types of cloth? To what extent could the resistance of weavers
lead to modifications in the system's provisions p. 44

Instead,  however, we get different cultural categoris. IN early days both payed by the piece.

>"If we
did not pay them by piece and by results," a spokesman for Lancashire mill
owners claimed in 1891, "the manufacturing concerns would not be able to
keep above water twelve months."[12] The economic environment limited
the mode of payment, but cultural assumptions precipitated its form. p. 45

However, how the pay systems manifested their pay, England based on length and density o f cloth and Germany based on the activity of the shuttle moving back and forth. You get paid by the number of shots per shuttle.


>In both German and English, the referents of ordinary
language marked the immediacy of the association between the weft threads
and the labor activity, since the words picks and Schüsse could pertain either
to the shuttles' motion or to the product, the woven weft.[18] When
practice itself became a concrete form of language in the operation of the
piece-rate scales, the choice of referent became unmistakable. Verbal
utterances were multivocal, the silent language of production—the piece-rate
mechanism—invariable. In comparing types of labor, the German and British
systems designated distinct objects. The German piece-rate system centered
its comparisons of different ways of weaving on the motion of inserting a
pick, without respect to the visible length of the complete product. The
British pattern compared the picks in different kinds of finished products
rather than in motions. p. 50

For Biernacke, this distinction is core to the question of vaalue.

>The translation of the British data onto the German dimensions of thought
also enables us to understand how the unpretentious language of practice—
the concepts incarnated in the weavers' daily labor for a wage—guided the
weavers' independent reflections upon the appropriation of labor. When
British weavers had more than one shuttle or one warp beam in operation—
which was very often the case—their payment per shot did not necessarily
increase as the number of shots per inch declined p.51

People began to argue about how much they were getting paid differently.
>The workers' recognition of inequity and their
resistance to exploitation were not given automatically by their resolve to
pursue their interests. Rather, the weavers' very understanding of their
interests depended on the cultural suppositions they called upon to interpret
their predicament. The assumptions about labor through which they defined
their situation derived from the signifying process embedded in the very
operation of the piece-rate mechanism. p. 54

That is, the symbolic concepts that poeple use to make sense of things differed based on the different wages. Germans thought about the piece rates as a standard measure of how much work was being done. In England, because its measurements were less precise, people argued over how much they would get for a specific product.

This discrepancy gave Marx a sense of what's goign on.

>"Labor," Marx wrote, "is the substance and immanent
measure of value, but has itself no value."[52] Labor as a visible activity
produces but lacks value; labor as a commodity in the moment of exchange
has value but does not produce it.[53] To order the disparity between an
action without exchange value and its sterling product, the Germans and the
British drew upon different fictions. The British, with pay by length, first
drew systematic (linear) relations between types of whole cloth and then
projected these distinctions onto the weaving activity. The Germans took the
use of the labor power, or the execution of the activity, as the basis for
defining the relative values of fabrics. They did things the other way around
from the British: they drew systematic (linear) differences between types of
labor and then projected them onto the cloth. p. 60

Germans complained about work intensification in terms of the extra shts they had to do. And earnings by shot seemed more coherent to the GErmans, though not necessarily more profitable. In Britain, nobody did that.

>If the contrasting principles embedded in the operation of German and
British piece-rate scales can be explained neither by the mute exigencies of
the labor process nor by the legacy of earlier changes at the point of
production, where are we to turn for an understanding of their development
and significance? To construct weavers' piece-rate scales, managers in both
Germany and Britain could not just measure the effort or time taken to
weave a single type of cloth. They had to come up with a way of equating
the different kinds of labor that went into different kinds of cloth. They could
not accomplish this by empirical tests, because weaving was neither a simple
process of tending a machine nor a matter of applying one's skill and energy
directly as an artisan would, without the interposition of an unmastered
technology. Either of these ideal types of production facilitates the empirical
measurement of labor in terms of time or, what may amount to the same
thing, in terms of the goods it takes a certain amount of time to produce.
Weaving, by contrast, consisted of an interaction between the worker,
unreliable tools, quirky raw materials, and weather, to turn out a large and
changing array of patterns p. 72

Business owners came up with this stuff pretty  much made it up.

### Defining Fines

In the different countries, differetn notions of fines emerged for working incorrectly. People had a tolerance for how much damaged cloth came in. If it was too much, British managers would take out what the amount was on the market.

>If the system arose because the agents believed that the market
functioned as the true arbiter of the value of the weaver's labor product in
Britain, might weavers have benefited from the system? Did refunds accrue
retroactively to weavers for cloth which, contrary to earlier expectations,
managed to clear the market? p. 76

Germans on the other hand, made refunds in the factory. The issue there was whether the workw as done negligently or recklessly.

>Since German owners
treated the fines principally as a deterrent to poor-quality production rather
than as compensation for a loss suffered in the market, they often chose an
alternative method for giving weavers an incentive to maintain high
standards of work: they paid a bonus for each unobjectionable piece p. 77

In Britian they lost money based on labor product, in Germany they lost money based on labo power. We also see that in Britain it doesn't necessarily matter who is providing the piece of cloth, whereas in Germany if they get sick and need someone else to do something they must get permisison from the factory, and sometimes the factory chooses the person.

Britain often tied wages in other settings to the market. This was not always the casein Germany.

This is how Marx, from Germany, ended up with a different set of ideas than the english economists.

### Strategy for Specifying Culture's Effect
We saw through strategic comparisons that culture is there. The commodity of labor was thought of idfferently in different places.

>By comparing factories that developed in similar environments, this study
shows not only that culture was necessary for building the regimes of the
factory but also that it was independent of the immediate economic
environment and was constitutive of the form of practice. Only a controlled
comparison can advance this more decisive point. p. 91

>This
approach, like the structuralist understanding of culture, makes culture in
the first instance a way of interpreting the capitalist production process
rather than a principle composing it. Finally, we have not treated culture as
a means of legitimating institutions. p.91

## The Control of Time and Space

There is something about the relationship between culture as schema and culture as practice that I don't really understand.

We think concepts are objects - cateogires of culture become  instruments of power because they demarcate the imaginable course of action - but practice as a signifying unction.

The idea is that there are different disciplinary regimes of the two different cultural understandings of labor.

### Time Measurements

There was a notion of efficiency ratio, the relative time lost due to stoppages. This only made sense in Germany.


>If German administrators, in the course of computing wages, also had to
ascertain every week the number of shots executed on each loom, they had
on hand the key figures needed for determining the efficiency ratio. Did the
Germans decide to calculate this percentage as an incidental consequence of
their adoption of the system of pay by shot? After all, their clerks already
had a tally of shots carried out that was lacking among the British
accountants. Or did use of the ratio carry a meaning of its own, based on the
German designation of labor as a commodity? p. 99

Workers in Germany used the efficiency ratio as the index of explotiation. You can tell that an increase in efficiency would add more profit but not as much take home pay.

### Tiem Jurisdiction

British people were given strong controls over entry and exit to the factory. They closed and locked the doors often. There was a ritual stopping when everyone  stopped for breakfast or lunch. This was called locking out, and people could only get back in during breaks, and then only sometimes.

>In Germany, where the workday was conceived
as the elapse of continuous time, not just a temporal succession, time
discipline placed more emphasis upon the duration of production than on its
beginning and end points. p. 113

Germans monetized tardiness in small accountings. "The time of living labor became a form of property for whose loss employers exacted a refined compensation." p.115

>Since employers and workers in Germany conceived of work time as a
continuous process of converting labor power into an output, they treated it
as something that could be abstracted from its context and transferred. In
the earliest days of the factory system, German workers themselves had
proposed that tardy arrivals be allowed to make up lost minutes by working
late.[96] Many factory directors gave their work force the option of taking
off early from work during unofficial religious or communal holidays under
the condition that the lost hours be made up by working an hour of over- . 119

>The systems for controlling workers' entrances and exits in the textile
industry can be generalized to other trades with large work premises. In
Germany tardy metal workers and engineers were simply fined,[102]
whereas the custom of shutting late workers outside the factory gate
emerged in many enterprises in Britain p. 121

### Frontiers of Discipline

In Britain, they thought of the doorways as a zone f total control.

>By comparison with Britain, the form in which labor was commodified in
Germany depreciated the importance of the doorway as a zone of contact
with employers. At many German mills the managers relinquished central
responsibility for recording entry and shifted the onus of keeping track of
workers' attendance and punctuality to the individual overlookers  p124

In Germany, they thought of late arrival as not managing to set your machine up in time.

It seems as though different practices build on different practices, but the question is whether there is a master logic at work here.

>In regulating border crossings, British employers made more of a claim to
the workers' presence in the confines of the factory than to their time at the
loom. p. 126

They sometimes also had to wear different clothes in Germany, work clothes at the mill. British people wore their own clothes.

In Britain the mills were built like fortresses.

>the editor of one set of German mill plans even boasted
that an exemplary weaving building was accessible from three separate
points after workers had entered the grounds.[165] When large German
complexes were erected at once around a central space, such as the Flax Mill
of Schoeller, Mevissen, & Bücklers in Düren, they could have emphasized the
enclosure of workers and observation of their movement through a central
yard. Instead, they opened up onto the adjacent gardens and fields.[166]
In Britain, the fortress design could be employed in "rationalized" mills,
where each processing room was located around the perimeter for the most
efficient movement of raw materials, as well as in haphazardly organized
older mills, where the stages of processing the materials were not
necessarily assigned sequentially in adjacent work rooms.[ p. 138


#### Summary
>The present study suggests that powerful impressions of labor as a
commodity, which showed prominent variations between countries, were not
deliberately generated by formal organizations for the dissemination of
ideas. They were not subsidized by the state or by a class but were born in
the producers' lived experience at the point of production. Cultural
formulations are transmitted through the form of instrumental practice, in
addition to conventional verbal communication. For example, the procedures
for entering the mill comprised both a humdrum action of individuals' daily
routine and a public ritual through which the meaning of labor was
communicated and re-endorsed in a shared setting.[183] The ideologies of
labor as a commodity were sustained not because they were consistent with
or corresponded to everyday procedures but because they were part and
parcel of them, brought to life because practice was designed as a mode of
communication. p. 143


## Cultural Location of Overlookers

In Germany, overlooker contracts which were seen as part of operating costs shows that there was a focus on their dispositions.

>My interpretation of the German courts' emphasis on labor power, far from
representing a kind of philosophic abstraction, does nothing more than follow
the thoughts of the participants themselves. In an age when owners usually
regarded the small stratum of professional employees as a species apart
from the manual workers under command, the owners nonetheless used the
term labor power for a factory official's technical services.[ p. 164


>German and British weaving overlookers shared the same dependencies and
capabilities with respect to employers above and weavers below. In each
country the structure of the production site generated similar conflicts
among these parties. Yet due to the understandings of labor as a
commodity, the paradigms on which people could draw for interpreting
friction varied between Germany and Britain, endowing identical problems
with contrasting significance. The British and German definitions of labor as
a commodity hold contrasting implications for the owner's authority in the
workplace. The German view of employment as the command of "labor
power" made the exercise of authority over the execution of work an integral
part of the process of earning a profit. The German view unified the relations
of appropriation and domination. When capitalists purchased "labor power,"
their receipt of a profit depended on how successfully they converted that
labor capacity into labor itself. Without the immediate domination of the
worker, the owner did not appropriate a surplus. Marx believed as a matter
of theory, not of rhetoric, that the capitalist organization of work was
despotic. Although profit may have been realized through exchange on the
market, it was generated and appropriated in production.
The purchase of embodied labor in Britain, by contrast, denied any
necessary connection between the exercise of authority and the generation
of profit. The producers may certainly have believed that the factory
proprietor took advantage of his command over capital to pay workers less
than he ought. Even so, the owner secured a surplus through an exchange
relation p. 166

There is a long list of mill complaints which goes to show, right, that the different conceptions of labor drawn from (or perhaps creating) different practices at work led to different types of complaints.

>The prominent commitment of British employers to molding an obedient
community outside the point of production attracted the criticism of German
employers. As a businessman from the German wool trade judged in 1886,
"To encourage the factory director to exercise surveillance over his people
even beyond the work hours in order to look after their moral health—this is
one English institution that has been taken too far. By this means one
develops only empty-headed workers."[169] We should not accede
unreservedly to the national contrast this executive wished to draw. But his
sentiments undermine the presumption that German employers were
automatically more custodial. What differed fundamentally between British
and German employers was not the general readiness to supervise or control
workers but the catego-ries of social consciousness by which they defined the exchange of labor at
the point of production. If the emphasis on the disposition over labor power
in the German factory had derived from a general cultural emphasis on
authority, we would expect the authoritarianism to carry over into all
contexts. Instead, in the community, where social relations were mediated
by capitalist relations of production but not cast directly in their image,
British employers appear no less interested than their German counterparts
in controlling subordinates' leisure, religion, and education. p. 195-6

#### Summary

>Weaving overlookers in Germany and Britain had
the same technical roles, similar locations in the factory hierarchy, similar
positions in the labor market, matching levels of pay, and the same
responsibilities for supervising workers. Given these structural parallels, the
divergent cultural definitions of labor as a commodity in Germany and Britain
intervened to give overlookers different statuses. In Britain, the view that
labor was sold via its products accentuated the aspect of the overlookers'
activity that corresponded to that of a productive agent. In Germany, the
view that labor was sold as a service placed an emphasis on the overlookers'
exercise of authority in the name of the owner rather than on the delivery of
a product; in this manner, the German view defined the overlooker's role as
essentially unlike that of a worker p. 196


>In this chapter, as in the two preceding, I have relied on three forms of
argument to demonstrate that the cross-national divergences in textile
factory institutions had a cultural origin. Most important, I have compared
similar business environments in detail to rule out alternative, utilitarian
explanations for differences in factory procedures—in this instance, the
allocation of overlooking costs—or for differences in the ascription of
authority. In particular, my comparisons have excluded explanations based
on the timing of the founding of textile mills, on adaptation to the business
cycle, or on national variation in the factory directors' commitment to
improving efficiency. Second, I have shown that the differing views of labor
as a commodity in Britain and in Germany extended into minutiae of factory
life where variation did not bear strategic consequences, such as the formal
methods for distributing overlooking wages over various types of cloth. The
shape of practice in these instances, too, is unamenable to utilitarian
explanation. Finally, the contrasting cultural definitions of labor as a
commodity in Germany and Britain which found expression in the methods
of defining overlookers' remuneration serve as the core principles for
interpreting an entire constellation of factory customs. The scope of the
instrumentalities elucidated by a cultural principle raises our confidence in
the method of analysis and challenges the advocates of purely utilitarian
reasoning to account for this range of differences between German and
British textile mills. Let them bring their case before the court. p.201


## REflections on Part One

This was not about understanding whether cultural or material forces were more powerful.

>The discovery that factory production in Germany and Britain was
orchestrated according to its signifying function bears important implications
for sociological theories about the distinguishing character of human action
in the capitalist order. Many in the tradition of Western Marxism have viewed
the increasing salience of exclusively calculative, instrumental conduct as a
characteristic developmental tendency of capitalist society.[188] But looking
at the sensuous realm of practice on the shop floor from a comparative
perspective discloses a more complex process. One can, perhaps, refer to
the "rationalization" of the labor process at the very end of the nineteenth
century, when formal ideologies of management appeared and the legal
system, at least in Germany, elaborated more explicitly the rules governing
the transmission of labor in the factory. But the development of capitalism
was not marked by the progressive reduction of the activity of labor to the
logic of instrumental action alone, without respect for action's
communicative function. Instrumental action, rationalized by progressive
adjustments to end-means logic, was still ordered by its conveyance of meaning and
followed the cultural coordinates of a commodity form that varied apart from
immediate economic conditions. p. 203

The initial schema only needs to be thought of by a few, because afterwards when it is put into practice all those who do such practices are subject to such schema.

>The question that remains unanswered is not how a patterned cultural
system was maintained, but, simply, why and how do practices cohere to
begin with? The matched comparison of economic environments for British
and German factories shows that, in each country, alternative conventions
would have met the requirements of the firm in the realm of capitalist
competition equally well. If a method for, say, the imposition of fines is
installed under one form of labor as a commodity, the choice of form for
other techniques is not entailed by practical necessity. What generated the
tendency toward consistency of form? p. 204

This is a good question.

>Only in capitalist society is labor both a form of
understanding and the integrative principle that regulates social relations in
society as a whole; only there does it bridge lived experience a  nd the
invisible functioning of a system. p.208

>If these considerations render intelligible the patterning of practice by a
specification of labor as a commodity, yet they do not explain why the
concepts of labor differed between Germany and Britain. To answer this
question requires us to uncover the historical genesis of the divergent
concepts and the conditions governing their transmission in quotidian
practice. That is the task in Part Two of this work. p.209

## Reading from the Summary at the End
