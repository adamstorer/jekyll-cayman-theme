# Chapter 2

Why do organizations make bad decisions? Economic strain might be part of it (amoral calculation - people look at their financial situation and do things based on money without respect for the law), but we know that not all organizations violate laws and rules to attain goals. Also, bad decisions can come from other places.

Vaughan thought at first that maybe amoral calculation played a part, but it is a strawman.
