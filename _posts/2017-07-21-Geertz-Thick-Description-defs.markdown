This reading is the first chapter in Geertz's book The Interpretation of Cultures.

Geertz begins by criticizing the treatment of the concept of culture, and individual's difficulty in defining it. He argues that Kluckhohn defines culture in many different ways, from "the total way of life of a people" to "an abstraction from behavior" and many others.

Geertz argues that, along with Weber, culture is the "webs of significance [man] himself has spun" p.5 In this way studying culture means interpreting how people make meanings.
Geertz argues that we can get a better sense of understanding culture by understanding it is that ethnography does. For Geertz this is "thick description"

This means, for instance, telling the difference between a wink and an eye twitch, describing what's happening but what's more, describing the meaning beyond what's happening.

<def>Thick Description: Acting as an interpreter, practicing ethnogrpahy by understanding the meaning of the actions to the actors.</def>

For ethnographers, the data is "our own constructions of other poeple's constructions of waht they and their compatriots are up to" p.9

Thick descriptions bring the data - but where does the analysis come in? Analysis is the sorting out the structures of signification, and determing their social ground and importance.

The ethnographer is faced with "a multiplicity of complex conceptual structures, many of them superimposed upon or knotted into one another, which are at once strange, irregular, and inexplicit, and which he must contrive somhow first to grasp and then to render" p10


Culture  is "symbolic action" But it doesn't matter, it matters what they mean to themselves.

Culture is not - self-contained, super-organic reality with forces of its own. It is not a pattern of behavioral events we observe to occur in some community. It is not in the minds and hearts of men. It is not whatever it is one has to know or believe in order to operate in a manner acceptable of its members. It is not, then, the writing out of systematic rules.

The last one is quite similar to Geertz, and the difference is that, in describing lots of rules you lose out on all of the things that got you there (i guess?) You don't simply know how to wink, but  you need to know how to use the wink correctly in society. You need to know how to use the actions as signs. This is really the perspective, as far as iI can tell.

<def>Understanding Culture, for Geertz: Understanding actions as signs within meaning structures.</def>

For Geertz, the aim of anthropology is the "enlargement of human discourse" p.14
Culture is a context to be described and understood.

Cultural systems don't really have to cohere, though there is probably some coherent, but you still have to allow for a lot of incoherence.

<def>Geertz's four characteristics of ethnographic description: it  is interpretive, it interprets the flow of social discourse, and the interpretation consists in trying to "rescue the 'said' of such discourse from its perishing occasions and fix it in perusable terms"p.20. Finally, it is microscopic</def>

So what do you do with all your little pieces of data? We theorize semiotically to gain access to "the conceptual world in which our subjects live so that we can, in some extended sense of the term, converse with them" 24

But I am skeptical of how one might really build some theory in this manor, by failing to disaggregate or try and make some sort of model of a culture.

"The essential task of theory building here is not to codify abstract regularities but to make thick desciprtion possible, not to general across cases but to generalize within them" p.26 - This is verging on meaningless for me (I am alienated!)

So cultural theory is not meant to be preditive,it is "strange science," and I still don't understand why you wouldn't want to generalize to build a general theory of culture.
