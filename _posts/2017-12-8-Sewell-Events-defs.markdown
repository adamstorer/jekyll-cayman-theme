Abstract: "Ever since Herodotus, historians have written about events. Battles, alliances, scandals, conquests, conspiracies, revolts, royal successions, reforms, elections, religious revivals, assassinations, discoveries momentous events have always been the bread and butter of narrative history. But despite the prominence of events in historical narratives, the event has rarely been scrutinized as a theoretical category. Tradi- tional narrative historians who revelled in the contingency and particu- larity of events generally refused on principle to engage in explicit theorizing. Meanwhile, historical sociologists, along with the minority of historians who turned to the social sciences in order to escape the hegemony of political narrative, generally disdained the study of mere events and sought instead to discover general causal patterns underly- ing historical change. This was true of the Annales school in France from the late 1920s forward and of the "new social history" that blos- somed in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. By the 1980s the old antagonisms between narrative history and historical sociology had begun to fade; yet theoretical work on historical events has remained relatively rare.2 I begin by outlining a theoretical concept of the his- torical event, but then refine the theory by using it to analyze particular historical happenings that took place in France in the summer of 1789. I am convinced that an adequate theorization of events can only be built up through a mutual interrogation of theoretical categories and real historical sequences."

>Ever since Herodotus, historians have written about events. Battles, alliances, scandals, conquests, conspiracies, revolts, royal successions, reforms, elections, religious revivals, assassinations, discoveries: momentous events have always been the bread and butter of narrative history.

Tradi- tional narrative historians who revelled in the contingency and particu- larity of events generally refused on principle to engage in explicit theorizing.

What is the role of events in social life? There are social and cultural structures and events neeed to be integrated into this. Here is Sewell's Idea
1. Structures are both the medium and the outcome of the practices which constitute social systems. Structures shape practices, but people's practices also shape structures.
2. Structures overlap. It is an unevenly articulated network.
3. Structures are composed of schemas, resources, and power. Schemas provide meanings and motivations, resources provide schemas with the means and stakes of action, power regulates action.

>I argue that events should be conceived of as sequences of occurrences
that result in transformations of structures. Such sequences begin with
a rupture of some kind - that is, a surprising break with routine practice.

The breaks are common, but it might happen with respect to one particular location. This is an OCCURENCE.

OCCURENCES become EVENTS when they touch off a chain of events that durably transform previous structures and practices.

When is this likely? For instance if an occurence somewhere causes an occurence somewhere else.

>Ruptures
spiral into transformative historical events when a sequence of
interrelated ruptures disarticulates the previous structural network,
makes repair difficult, and makes a novel rearticulation possible. p. 5

So what is a historical event?
1. A ramified sequence of occurense
2. That is recognized by contemporaries
3. That results in durable transformation of structures

I guess the issue is - how can you be sure that it's not the cart pulling the horse? We just read about how narratives about the sit ins focus on spontaneity when in fact they are highly organized activities. Events are not RECOGNIZED by contemporaries, they are hoisted upon onlookers by contemporaries with a fully formed logic already there. Social Movement Organizations and their role seems like it has to be considered, and in this case an EVENT might actually be one in an arsenal of techniques.


## France

In 1789 the Monarch and the National Assembly had sharply different ideologies for WHY they were in power, and they were both vyiing for the same power. Then, the Monarch tried to take down the National Assembly. The National Assembly mobilized individuals and helped individuals to take the bastille.

This was a complex set of events that somehow ended up as the taking of the bastille. The thing was construed as an act of the people's sovereign will.

>This construal required a dramatic and
utterly unforeseen articulation between two modes of activity not previously
understood as linked: on the one hand, political and philosophical
claims about the sovereignty of the people, of the sort that
delegates of the Third Estate used when they declared themselves the
National Assembly; on the other, acts of crowd violence of the sort that
the Parisian populace used to defend themselves and the National
Assembly from the king's troops on July 14. p.13

So there is this idea of a REVOLUTION which is a supreme event that we have not seen int he past.

The assembly thought the taking of the Bastille was bad because now some crazed mob was in charge. The day after, when the assemblymen visited paris they changed their tune. IT became increasingly clear that these people were very much on their side and that they would be very well served by getting on baord.

>By the morning of July 18, the astonishing results of the taking of the
Bastille were clear. The troops had been sent back to their barracks in
the provinces, Necker had been recalled, the king had essentially capitulated
to both Paris and the National Assembly, Paris had a redoubtable
urban militia and a new vigorously patriot municipality, and the
last of the nobles had ended their boycott and joined in the work of the
Assembly. Meanwhile, proclamations supporting the Assembly came
pouring in from the provinces, indicating that its new political supremacy
was national, not merely Parisian. The barriers that had kept the
National Assembly from its self-appointed task of providing France
with a new constitution were suddenly swept away. The Parisian uprising
had resulted in a triumph of astounding proportions for the National
Assembly, which henceforth became the chief arbiter of the
Nation's fate. p.17

I guess I just feel like, the only way this could be right is because there is not enough evidence to prove otherwise. I'm also not sure still what the role of the event is here.

## Theory

So, we got a rearticulation of structures from the storming of the bastille.

>As I see it, the taking of the Bastille could only become the
founding act of the French Revolution - and of the modern concept of
revolution in general - because it took place at a time when political
structures were massively dislocated. The National Assembly had
declared the people's will to be sovereign, but because it was engaged
in an inconclusive struggle with the king, it had not yet definitively
established its own claim to represent that will. It was because sovereignty
was up for grabs that the taking of the Bastille could be interpreted
as a direct and sublime expression of the nation's will - that an
act of popular violence could be articulated directly with sovereignty to
form the new political category of revolution.

This rearticulation spurred more reconfiguration of schemas. These are of course, mediated by particular conditions.

They are characterised by heightened emotion and somehow acts of collective creativity.

Also, historical events are ritualized - the unique events

I feel like the general idea is good and Sewell needs some theory of change to complete his total analysis of society. I just think that the requirememtns for what an event or revolution is is overly specific to the French Bastille case, a case in which one has very little knowledge to say with certainty that some combination of facts are true, and also only a single case. And yet somehow, the are the ideal typical event? Or Revolution? Also mixed with the fact that some social groups have an intense interest in making thing sseem some certain way.
