Many books about job satisfaction/labor were the result of a dramatic 1972 strike.

> researchers in the 1970s gave insufficient attention to the so-called “extrinsic” features of the work environment—pay and other economic benefits, job security, and opportunities for promotion. Attitude surveys show that these are still very important to blue-collar workers. For example, workers who regard their income as adequate and their job security as good are five times more likely to be very satisfied with their jobs than are those who think that their income is inadequate and their job insecure. 4 Dissatisfied workers complain more about extrinsic factors like hours, earnings, job insecurity, and company policy than they do about intrinsic factors such as “the work itself. p.2

Unions could help enhance these extrinsic issues. This book is all about understanding how industrial labor was transformed and how good jobs were created. It becomes:

> It is, therefore, an account of the bureaucratization of employment, since many of the features that define good jobs—stability, internal promotion, and impersonal, rule-bound procedures—are characteristic of bureaucratic organization. We will also examine the upheaval in the labor markets of the 1980s and 1990s, which has caused a reduction in the number of good jobs.

People hoped for bureacracy to enhance their bargaining power, and the rise of bureaucracy made it more difficult for employers to use their discretion. Some thought bureacracy would prevent unionism. For Jacoby bureaucracy is not a totality.

>This study takes a different approach. It treats bureaucratic employment practices as the outcome of a prolonged struggle to overcome the insecurity and inequities produced by a market-oriented employment system. The struggle was played out both within management and between management and other groups; its result was by no means inevitable. At a broader level, this struggle was part of what Karl Polanyi called “the double movement” of two great organizing principles in society. One was the principle of economic liberalism, which used laissez-faire and contract as its methods; the other was the principle of social protection, which relied on protective legislation, restrictive associations, and other methods of market intervention p.3

Unions sometimes pushd for bureaucatization in order to provide more security and dignity for industrial workers that existed for white collar workers. Some bureaucratization took place by hiring personnel managers who were cut from a different cloth, often progressives that pushed things in a direction more in favor of laobr. IT seems that even as unions fold and work becomes more progressive, some of the ideas of bureaucratization continue.

My reading of this book skips the history of labor in chapters 1-6 and focuses on the more contemporary period (starting in 1933) with chapter 7

## Response to Depression

The depression was so bad nobody really knew waht to do. People were focused on seasonal unemployment and the production of a stable work force but werne't really getting them before 1930. A lot of times plans to stabilize workers really only dealt with whtie collar workers anyway.

People had also tried work sharing. THis is basically making people part time instead of laying people off. In reality, people did this in addition to layoffs. Some unions liked it while others didn't. Work sharing was seen as a compromise that would stop things like unemployment insurance.  People also tried to promise to keep wages stable, but this meant somethign more along the line of wage sharing.


### Formulation of a Strategy

As promises by the organizations kept on getting broken labor saaw a possibility to organize. A law in 1933 gave workers the formal right to organize.

>Workers formed unions, sometimes spontaneously, and struck to demand employer recognition. Unions that had sickened after 1929, including those of the miners and clothing workers, quickly revived. New federal labor unions, directly chartered by the AFL, began to appear in industries where they had previously been rare, including rubber tires, electrical manufacturing, automobiles, and petroleum refining. Between June and October 1933, the AFL and its member unions issued charters to 3,537 federal labor union locals. p.166

It became clear that any type of strike at some point would be looked at negatively as employers not caring about their employees. Companies tried to produce company unions but it didn't seem to really work out too well. People also tried to train the formen to deal with all sorts of labor programs.

Bureaucratic response such as the formation of specific company policies and responses helped it seem like workers had the right idea of what was going on.

>On the other hand, the labor boards might exonerate an employer who could prove that a dismissal was motivated not by antiunion sentiment but by the worker’s violation of an established rule or some other “objective factor.” 116 Thus, disciplinary rules proliferated, and efforts to keep detailed service records were initiated. Foreman training programs included careful discussions of the new company rules, section 7(a), and, later, the Wagner Act. p.173


> Most companies continued to be characterized by an absence of rules and restraint. In 1935, over half of all firms still allowed their foremen to be the sole arbiters of dismissal; over three in five lacked dismissal rules; and four in five had no definite procedure for layoffs. Seniority was not widely recognized as an allocative determinant, nor were most workers protected by other devices that assured their job security, such as employment guarantees, rehiring rules, or stabilization policies. 131 Although personnel managers called for company-wide promotion policies, explicit career ladders were rare, and there were numerous complaints that foremen continued to block interdepartmental promotions.

## Another Great Transformation

Unions continued to put pressure on to jobs, though in kind of a strange way.
>But some firms moved so slowly, even after 1935, that few changes were made before the unions moved in and expanded whatever rules, job security measures, and standardized procedures were in place. Occasionally, a company did not even have a personnel department until after a union had organized its workers. 7 More commonly, however, unionization occurred after the firm had already implemented a range of employment reforms. In such cases, unions adapted to the status quo and used preexisting policies as a basis for formulating new demands, sometimes incorporating the firm’s personnel policies into the collective agreement. Developments in the unionized sector were closely watched and imitated by firms that had managed to avoid unionization. p. 180

This means that some companies adapted, unions moved in response to that adaptation, and finally outside firms responded to the threat of unionization.

One of the meain innovations that unions brough was job security. This is where some of the bureaucratization took place, where hiring by seniority became one of the most important parts of a unionized workforce. This is an interesting departure from Edwards take that unions are so different.

Union firms varied somewhat in whether they wanted hour reductions or layoffs. And the union strategies flipped as time went on while nonunion strategies did not. Very strange stuff here.

Another thing unions pushed for was guaranteed wages or income, and promotions.

But the interesting thing here is that you cannot look at one organization only, there are many organizations, some unionized andsome non-unionized in a field, and the non-union actors are often influenced by the union actors.

Bureaucratization again, in the form of policy statements and intense policies, protected employers from potential litigation in the context of unions.

>At nonunion firms, merit rating was seen as a tactical necessity. Thompson Products was in the midst of an organizing drive when it introduced a rating plan in 1939. The firm distrusted its foremen and thought the plan would reduce worker charges of discrimination. As the company told its foremen, the plan would also be “of untold value if at some future date” stricter seniority rules were demanded. 49 Unionized firms had similar motives for introducing merit rating. First, it forced foremen to be more fair and consistent, thus weakening the basis for union demands to give greater weight to seniority. Second, it provided hard data to justify departures from seniority, thus giving managements a better chance to win grievance disputes. p.188

It makes it harder to say that bureaucratization is like a form of control, or the way in which it is a form of control is a really interesting question. Employers also attempted to mold employe attitude through public relations campaigns!


#### Personnel Management
>As the foregoing suggests, personnel management served somewhat different functions in unionized and in nonunion firms. In nonunion companies, its function was preventive. Companies that avoided unionization were widely credited with having “good” personnel administration. Even the most traditional employers were now willing to grant that the personnel department constituted a “necessary evil” and “good insurance.” 59 The continuing irony in personnel management was that it best served the purpose of thwarting unionism by introducing the same reforms the unions sought.p.189

As the war produced greater demand for workers personnel departments became ubiquitous
>Employment policies began to move more rapidly in the direction set during the preceding period. Foremen were forced to defer to the personnel department and to follow company-wide procedures. Allocative practices and wage setting became enmeshed in increasingly rigid rules. Finally, employment security and other ties that bound a worker to his current employer were strengthened. The motive forces behind all these developments were the continued growth of unions and of government regulation, and the new need to conserve scarce labor. p.194

>As labor became scarcer during the war, informal methods of hiring proved inadequate to handle the demands of rapidly expanding companies. Consequently, recruitment and hiring became the most centralized and standardized of personnel activities. Few large firms continued to permit foremen to hire on their own (Table 7.2). Instead, workers were carefully recruited and then put through a bureaucratic rigmarole of application forms, interviews, and employment tests. To a much greater extent than during World War I, the army’s intelligence and psychological testing spilled over into private industry. By 1947, about one-fifth of all industrial firms relied on employment tests p.195

But personnell departments continued to look for ways to ustify their existence


## 1950s-Present

Between 1920 and 1950 workers became more attached to a certain area, partially because of the economic stability that union work created.

>This drop in mobility was one of the most important consequences of the employment system that had become widespread for manufacturing workers. Seniority rules and internal promotion policies gave workers a reason to remain with their employers. Grievance systems and nonunion complaint procedures provided an alternative to quitting and reduced the probability of being fired. Of course, a heavier use of layoffs counterbalanced the decline in dismissals, but because of rehiring commitments and because seniority was retained over a long period, workers on layoff were less likely to change jobs...
The decline in geographic mobility also helped to create (though much later than is commonly supposed) stable, working-class communities centered on the workplace. Two points should be noted here. First, this phenomenon undoubtedly eased the task of organizing labor unions during the 1930s, and so indirectly fostered lower levels of job mobility. Second, it suggests that workers’ ardent pursuit of job security after 1930 stemmed not only from a fear of unemployment but from an urge to protect these new forms of communal stability. Thus, changes in the workplace and in the community were mutually reinforcing. p.206


As personnel management developed it moved from the bureaucratic systematization of policies and breakdown of job titles to a fuller understanding of how workers think. That is, perhaps, companies acknowledge the psychology of their employees.

>Another development in the postwar decades was the growing gap between “labor relations” and “employee relations.” Labor relations became the province of specialists concerned with collective bargaining and contract administration, whereas employee relations encompassed all other aspects of the employee company relationship. Labor relations departments were found only in unionized firms, a group whose size stopped growing in the early 1950s. p.209

Personnel managers became concerned with the quality of work life for some reason, perhaps in an effort to increase productivity.

> companies in the 1970s had stepped up the pace of their union-avoidance activities, such that the supply of new nonunion plants increased steadily over the decade. Union avoidance became more prevalent in the 1970s because it was easier to do—unions were weaker than before; because the cost of operating union facilities rose sharply in the inflationary 1970s, thus creating an incentive to open nonunion plants; and because the new behavioral approach to work organization made nonunion plants harder for unions to crack. p.213

Also the decline of unions seemed even more important. It basically seems like a few things happened. The labor supply increased, the number of jobs that were concerned with unions decreased, and companies took advantage of the fall of unions to restructure their practices.

Jacoby argues that the deconstruction of internal labor markets an increasing precarity are hard to make sense of without further review.
