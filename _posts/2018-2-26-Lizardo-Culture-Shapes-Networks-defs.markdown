Abstract: "This article examines the relationship between different forms of cultural taste and the density of social contacts across alternative types of network relations classified by average tie strength. The author builds on Bourdieu's ([1986] 2001) classic statement on the “forms of capital” (economic, social, and cultural) and the conversion dynamics among them, and on DiMaggio's (1987) connection between cultural tastes and sociability. He hypothesizes that (1) in addition to cultural tastes being determined by network relations, cultural tastes are used to form and sustain those networks. Furthermore he expects that (2) highbrow culture taste will be less likely to be converted into social capital beyond immediate strong-tie circles due to its more restricted, “assetspecific” nature. Because of its generalized appeal, taste for popular culture will be more likely to be associated with weak-tie network density. The results broadly support these hypotheses: a model that specifies an effect of culture on network density provides a better fit to the data than the traditional conception of networks as determining taste. In addition using log-linear models and instrumental-variable methods, I show that popular culture consumption has a positive impact on weak-tie network density but not strong-tie network density, while highbrow culture consumption selectively increases strong-tie density but has no appreciable effect on weak ties, net of standard socioeconomic variables. These findings help to shed light on the mechanisms that translate mastery of different types of cultural knowledge into integration across distant social positions or closure around strong group boundaries. The author also discusses the implications of the results for current models describing the transformation of cultural into social resources."

People try to make sense of the relationship between culture and structure - but some see culture as simply part of the social structure. HOwever now we know culture is grounded in practice.

## Bourdieu and the Forms of Capital

Bourdieu argues that different types of capital can be converted. In principle, all forms are convertible. Bourdieu did not really think this all the way through though. Bourdieu was interested in how cultural capital morphed into economic capital, particularly through educational credentials.

>In this article
I am specifically interested in the alternative
process of conversion of informal cultural
knowledge (associated with different kinds of
taste) into social connections. p.3

## The Construction Model
HOw can culture be translated into social connections?
>The authors use a simple
assumption of similarity (homophily), which
postulates that the likelihood of a social tie
increases with the cultural similarity between
any given dyad (a dynamic process similar to the
one proposed by Homans [1950: 108–121]). In
this way the probability that two persons will
interact is driven by their cultural similarity.
Interaction, in this positive feedback loop, in its
turn increases cultural similarity as individuals
exchange their stocks of knowledge with one
another.

However - we do not know which types of cultural knowledge can convert into what kinds of social connections.

## Culture Consumption, the Arts, and Sociability

  DiMaggio's classification in art is a perhaps more detailed version of the construction model. the argument is that mass produced culture provides a baselinein cultural capital. In addition, there is a decline in traditional bonds, making ties more fluid.

  The arts, then, create the common culture currency.

  For Fiske, there is also a role for belonging to th same club or organization. THis is a new type of ti emaybe.

# The Conversion of Cultural Capital into Social Capital

  We think of social capital in terms of weak and strong tie.
  WE think of cultural capital in terms of highbrow and popular taste.

## Types of COnversion
>In the very same way that weak ties are
construed as beneficial because they traverse
wider portions of social space, I propose that
consumption of popular cultural forms is beneficial
because it provides the appropriate form
of cultural capital that is more likely to flow
through those types of (weaker) social connections. p.6

That culture with a broader distribution in social space will gain connections that are associated with that space. High brow culture is tied to a social position, and thus will create local connections which are stronger.

That is, we have a generalized and a particularized cultural capital, which creates restricted and elaborate codes.

>For Bernstein (1964:61), restricted codes
are more likely to be used when “the form of the
social relation is based upon some extensive
set of closely shared identifications by the members.”
The elaborate code on the other hand is
more likely to come into play when “role relations
receive less support from shared expectations. p.6

This is an argument that can be expressed in economic terms.

>Particularized
cultural capital, in contrast, is that which is only
“useful in keeping up a conversational ritual
but only with certain people.” Particularized
cultural capital is much more important in
Collins’s view (1988:406) in solidifying networks
of power and authority (Collins 1975), p.6

Popular culture, then, has a generalized conversion value because it may be more easily converetd into weak tie connections with heterogenous others.

Elite culture, has a restricted conversion value - it should b more likely to sustain recurrent, strong-tie networks and function in the long-established-status boundary-maintaining role.

## Are Cultural Tastes always an effect of network ties?

In other words, is the reciprocal true that networks shape cultural taste? Most people argue that networks shape tastes, but we see there is a distinctly different mode going on here. This is all commonly believed but never really measured at length.

>Thus the differentiation between particularized
and generalized cultural capital can be considered
roughly analogous to Erickson’s distinction
between coordination culture and domination
culture. Coordination culture is more useful for
forming and sustaining bridging ties among
socially distant positions (more likely to be
weak) while domination culture is more useful—
when used among people who have a
mutual understanding of its “proper” deployment—
for purposes of (upper) class cohesion p.9

# Empirical IMplications
H1 - Highbrow culture taste leads to a denser network of srong ties
H2 - Popular culture taste leads to a dnser network of weak ties.

This uses data from the GSS which tries to show the different types of culture a person might consume. The findings indicate that the hypotheses are true. LIzardo also uses an instrumental variable - but what is the instrument? I was under the impression that in order to do an instrumental variables type study you needed a good instrument.

>In accordance with Hypothesis 1, highbrow culture consumption
has a strong and statistically significant effect
on the number of contacts who are considered
close enough to discuss important matters with.
I find that popular culture consumption also
has positive impact on this outcome, although
the coefficient estimate is much smaller and
not statistically significant. More importantly,
notice what happens to the size of the education
and SES coefficients once we hold constant the
effect of culture consumption. Both are
decreased substantially, and neither reaches statistical
significance in Model 2. This suggests
that culture consumption is the intervening
mechanism that explains the often-noted association
between high status and having large
networks. p.22

# Summary
>Three conclusions emerge from these analyses:
(1) net of sociodemographic factors, highbrow
taste is more likely to be converted into a
denser network of strong ties, and popular taste
leads to an increasing number of weak ties; (2)
the net effect of highbrow (popular) taste on the
size of the portion of the network composed of
less-intimate (more-intimate) contacts is largely
null, as would be expected if this type of cultural
competence were not useful for the
sustenance of these types of network connections;
and (3) the positive effect of institutionalized
forms of cultural capital (such as
education) and of economic capital (as measured
by occupational earnings) on the size of the
personal networks is largely mediated through
embodied forms of cultural capital displayed in
the form of cultural taste.
