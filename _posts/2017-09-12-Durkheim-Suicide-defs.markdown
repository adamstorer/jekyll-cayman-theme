## Introduction

Trying to make sense of the fact of social suicide rate, and what depends on the social suicide rate. What factors felt by society as a whole contribute to suicide?
Three parts to understanding the causes:
1. What are the extra-social causes of broad generality that contribute to suicide.
2. How do these causes produce their effects?
3. What can we say about suicide and its relation to other social facts, and how can we prevent it.

# Book 1 - Extra Social Factors
<def> What are the two parts of suicide: organic-psychic dispositions and the nature of the physical environment. </def>
For organic psychic, we can think of suicide as a disease that one gets. If we want to say that, then every suicide is just a madman. And this doesn't make sense, and how could you ever draw out social influence from suicide?

Some kind of mental alienation might be happening but how could one prove this?

 WE have four kinds of suicide so far
 1. Maniacal Suicide due to hallucinations or delirium
 2. Melancholy Suicide due to sadness
 3. Obsessive Suicide - You want to kill yourself because you are obsessed with the idea even though you know it's goofy.
 4. Impulsive Suicide - It is unmotivated and simply an impulse

 This is to show that insanity is not the only reason for suicide. Let's look at some proportions to see how they're different. For instance, jews and women are craziest the most but suicide the least. We also do not find alcoholism to be a great predictor of suicide in a country.

 ## Suicide and Normal Psychological States - Race, Heredity

Can we break up suicides to some notion of race (even though race needs to be made up)
Not really,it seems like things like living in a large city or religion has more to do with it. There is no ethnicity or hereditary group that is prone to suicide.

## Cosmic Factors
We now turn to things like how sunny it is, how cold it is, etc.  They don't work very well either, except sometimes suicide takes place in summer. We find that days of the same length lead to suicide at very similarrates. But daytime is when social life is at its height.It seems like social life is important, as urban life has such an effect.

>To recapitulate: we first showed that the direct action of cosmic
factors could not explain the monthly or seasonal variations of suicide.
We now see the nature of its real causes, the direction in which they
must be sought, and this positive result confirms the conclusions of
our abstract analysis. If voluntary deaths increase from January to July,
it is not because heat disturbs the organism but because social life is
more intense.

## Imitation

You could be purely imitating others.
But what is imitation? Everyone thinks and feels in unison because we're all copying each other all the time.
Or, we may act in moral ways to keep unity within the society, and we obey conventions without caring about the morality behind it sometimes beause we take cues from others.
Or, we may simply copy someone because we saw it and unthinkingly do it.

But really in the first one we are reacting to impressions of how others will act as a means to stay similar.

Durkheim seems to think a lot of this imitation talk is really bs due to a strict definition of imitation:

<def>What is imitation for Durkheim?:Imitation exists when the immediate
antecedent of an act is the representation of a like act, previously performed by someone
else; with no explicit or implicit mental operation which bears upon the intrinsic nature of
the act reproduced intervening between representation and execution</def>  

Because otherwise we would be seeing some type of action that runs on society.

But we see suicide does not radiate out in a way it would if there's real imitation, instead it takes place in a kind of mass.

# Book Two: Social Causes and Social types

## How to determine social causes?
It's hard because we don't know, for sane people, enough about them to try and say at the individual level why they're commiting a certain type of suicide.

>For instance, we have
seen that alcoholism is not a determining factor of the particular aptitude
of each society, yet alcoholic suicides evidently exist and in great
numbers. No description, however good, of particular cases will ever
tell us which ones have a sociological character. If one wants to know
the several tributaries of suicide as a collective phenomenon one must
regard it in its collective form, that is, through statistical data, from the
start. The social rate must be taken directly as the object of analysis;
progress must be from the whole to the parts. p.100

>The reasons ascribed for suicide, therefore, or those to which
the suicide himself ascribes his act, are usually only apparent causes.
Not only are the reasons merely individual repercussions of a general
state, but they express the general state very unfaithfully, since they are
identical while it is not. They may be said to indicate the individualâ€™s
weak points, where the outside current bearing the impulse to selfdestruction
most easily finds introduction. But they are no part of this
current itself and consequently cannot help us to understand it p.104

So we must look above individuals to understand the social causes.

## Egoistic Suicide
Religion - Protestants are much more likely to commit suicide. And this somehow relates to the spirit of free inquiry that animates the religion.

<def>Durkheim on Reflection:Reflection develops only if its development becomes imperative, that is,
if certain ideas and instinctive sentiments which have hitherto
adequately guided conduct are found to have lost their efficacy. Then
reflection intervenes to fill the gap that has appeared, but which it has
not created. Just as reflection disappears to the extent that thought and
action take the form of automatic habits, it awakes only when accepted
habits become disorganized p.113</def>

And jews feel some kind of solidarity among themselves because of how unaccepted they are by everyone else. They are kind of immune to suicide partially because of this. Jews also do not inquire much into judaism because it is a traditional religion?

Once you are learn-ed you start to crave knowledge (don't take tradition as such) and then the weakening of a common faith seems to lead to suicide. Education itself does not correspond to suicide, but lack of a commmon faith + education does.

>Man seeks to learn
and man kills himself because of the loss of cohesion in his religious
society p.123

We also know that it is not any religious concept (protestants also believe god can send you to hell but have high rates, jews don't even believe in hell and have low rates) that leads people to suicide, but instead a collective religious faith.

## Egoistic Suicide Continued

Of adults, unmarried people commit suicide first.
Three rules from analyzing the data:
1. Too early marriages mean suicide
2. Marriages after 20 reduce suicide
3. This reduction varies by sex.

Your spouse dying makes you a little more likely to commit suicide than yo would have been otherwise

Also a bigger family makes you less likely to commit suicide

Also, wars or uprisings create a sense of community which leads to not suicide.

<def>Durkheim's summary of egoistic suicide: We see suicide varies inversely with integration of religious, domestic and political society. Therefore egoistic suicide comes from excessive individualism in the face of the social </def>

But then widows don't kill themselves because they never got too impregnated with society in the first place.

## Altruistic Suicide


<def>What is altruistic suicide?:Sometimes people kill themselves along some particular characterstics, such as getting old and sick, having a spouse die, or having a master die while you're the chief. In these cases, suicide is seen as a duty. But these duties are social construction. It is imposed by society or social ends. In these types of suicides, you are acting altruistically for the group rather than for the self. This suicide can be obligatory, optional or acute. </def>

Military suicide is a strange example, here people are integrated (though would not be so in civilian life). You are already putting yo;ur life on the line for society, and this can be taken too intensely (life on the line for individual people?)

>This is the
suicide of lower societies, in survival among us because military
morality itself is in certain aspects a survival of primitive morality.44
Influenced by this predisposition, the soldier kills himself at the least
disappointment, for the most futile reasons, for a refusal of leave, a
reprimand, an unjust punishment, a delay in promotion, a question of
honor, a flush of momentary jealousy or even simply because other
suicides have occurred before his eyes or to his knowledge. Such is
really the source of these phenomena of contagion often observed in
armies, specimens of which we have mentioned earlier. They are
inexplicable if suicide depends essentially on individual causes. It cannot
be chance which caused the appearance in precisely this regiment
or that locality of so many persons predisposed to self-homicide by
their organic constitution. p.198

## Anomic Suicide

>Whenever serious readjustments take place in the
social order, whether or not due to a sudden growth or to an
unexpected catastrophe, men are more inclined to self-destruction.
How is this possible? How can something considered generally to
improve existence serve to detach men from it? p.207

Maybe this is because people are not in the place they should be in?
>But it would be of little use for everyone to recognize the justice of
the hierarchy of functions established by public opinion, if he did not
also consider the distribution of these functions just. The workman is
not in harmony with his social position if he is not convinced that he
has his deserts. If he feels justified in occupying another, what he has
would not satisfy him. So it is not enough for the average level of needs
for each social condition to be regulated by public opinion, but
another, more precise rule, must fix the way in which these conditions
are open to individuals. p.211

In abnormal ties humans are more likely to question the authority of society and be less happy with their place in it.
>In the case of economic disasters, indeed, something like a declassification
occurs which suddenly casts certain individuals into a lower
state than their previous one. Then they must reduce their requirements,
restrain their needs, learn greater self-control. All the advantages
of social influence are lost so far as they are concerned; their moral
education has to be recommenced. But society cannot adjust them
instantaneously to this new life and teach them to practice the
increased self-repression to which they are unaccustomed. So they are
not adjusted to the condition forced on them, and its very prospect is
intolerable; p.213

Also people get unfortunate aspirations and then when they are not filled it's too bad.

>If anomy never appeared except, as in the above instances, in intermittent
spurts and acute crisis, it might cause the social suicide-rate to vary
from time to time, but it would not be a regular, constant factor. In one
sphere of social life, howeverâ€”the sphere of trade and industryâ€”it is
actually in a chronic state. p. 215

<def> Durkheim's summary of the three types of suicide, and in particular anomic suicide: Anomic suicide differs from the others in its dependence, not on the way in which individuals
are attached to society, but on how it regulates them. Egoistic
suicide results from manâ€™s no longer finding a basis for existence in
life; altruistic suicide, because this basis for existence appears to man
situated beyond life itself. The third sort of suicide, the existence of
which has just been shown, results from manâ€™s activityâ€™s lacking regulation
and his consequent sufferings. By virtue of its origin we shall
assign this last variety the name of anomic suicide. p.219 </def>

Basically, egoistic and altruistic suicide is out of track with a kind of mechanical version of solidarity, and anomic suicide is out of track with an organic version of solidarity.

When you get divorced you also commit anomic suicide.
>After all, what is marriage? A regulation of sexual relations, including
not merely the physical instincts which this intercourse involves
but the feelings of every sort gradually engrafted by civilization on the
foundation of physical desire. p.233
