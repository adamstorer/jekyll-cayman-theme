    Religion: A combination of beliefs and rites. Beliefs are states of opinion and consist of representation, rites are particular modes of action. These beliefs and actions are developed around the fundamental human categories of sacred and profane, and the particular beliefs deal with what is sacred/profane and the rites determine how to act around the sacred and profane.

# Introduction

By tracking the genealogy of religion you can understand more about society. We need to start with simple religions because modern religion is too complex and confusing. "How can one find the common basis of religious life under the luxuriant vegetation that grows over it?" p.5

In lower societies groups are very similar, and this lack of complexity translates into a similarity among the groups religion. But there is something fundamental in this.  "The distance between a systematized delusion and the first impressions that gave birth ot it is often considerable."

This way of doing this is a study that gets to something like the heart of man/human intellect, the root of our judgements and the fundamental notions that dominate our lfie.

>The general conclusion off the chapters to follow is that religion is an eminently social thing. Religious representations are collective representations that express collective realities; rites are ways of acting that are born only in the midst of assembled groups whose purpose is to evoke, maintain, or recreate certain mental states of those groups. p.9

One main social feature is that of religious calendars which work to organize human time in a way that makes sense to a group. Space works in the same way. The idea is that these essential organizing principles play a role in the development of the individual.

There is  a dichotomy between the notions that facts exist a priori, before human experrience, and the other side that categories are constructed by the individual. This is some difference between them and the empiricists who unfortunately beleive there is some sort of divine reason that individual emulates.

We know that there is common ground, a "social" that constructs the boundaries and contours of reason.

<def>Durkheim's combination of apriorists and empiricists: There are facts that are true and irreducible to one another, but the categories individuals use to make sense of those facts are collective, and socially constructed.</def>

There is a "social" that is above the individual, and it takes a different type of thinking to make sense of this.


# Preliminary Questions
What is religion? To figure out what this is, let's look at religions.

1. Religion is not the supernatural - this role is varied and religion often explains natural forces as much as it explains supernatural ones.
2. It is not recent -
3. It is not simply the divine - Many religions do not place role on a spiritual or divine entity

So therre are rites without gods.


These religious rites make a distinction between sacred actions (things you can only say sometimes, very important things you do once in a while), and profane actions. The sacred and the profane are absolutes for the individual.  They are absolutely separate in almost all human history.

Rites of initiation are long held sacred activities. There is some notion of sacred and profane as wholly oposite from each other, regardless of what the content of those things are.

But what leads man to see some things as sacred and profane?

### There is more!

There are magic cults as well, and magic has a sacred and profane, beleifs and rites, that are often flipped. So waht's the difference? Religious groups are pbrought together, unified by the beliefs and rites. It is inherently group based.

Magic is kind of like this, but does not bring together a group. Religions have standing places where rites are practiced. It is something inherenlty social.

# Conceptions of Elementary Religions
Durkheim essentially casts off a few different conceptions - those of animism (the idea that there are spirits that come to you in hallucinations). This religion does not express any experiential reality. Naturism, the worship of certain things like fire, or more directly, gods that represent fire. These ideas form some kind of "divine," but there is no distinction between mythology and religion.

#Totemism as Elementary Religion  
Naturism and Animism search for the divine in some set of phenomena that occur naturally. Both argue the seed should be found in nature.

But this assumes a creation out of nothing. "In one case it is the illusions of dreaming that suposedly brought about such a transfiguration; in the other it is the brilliant but vacant march of images evoked by words" p.84

Even more ancient is totemism - totems are found all over and have some system of generality to them. WE can find in australia a whole set of religious beliefs that are defined around totems.
Totemism essentially correctly defines our categories in a way that makes sense.

<def>Why are totemic beliefs the center of all religion?: They fill out the definition of religion that Durkheim set forth a priori, and they exist all over the world at very early times. They also contain some parts of what will turn into naturism or animism. </def>

# Book Two Chatper one - Principal Totemic Beliefs
Split into the beliefs and the rites.

Clans are the basic group for australian totemic religions, and there is a specific name that designate a group of things, and that name is the totem. The name brings the people together, and nobody else with the same name is part of that group (thoguh this name is not strictly solely a kin relation). Often time totems are the objects that bare the clans name, such as animals or plants, and very rarely inanimate things. For instance "the kangaroo"

>The totem is not simply a name; it is an emblem, a true coat of arms, and its resemblance to the heraldic coat of arms has often been commented upon. p.111

Sometimes the mark of the totem is imprinted on the body, and perhaps they do something with their hair. The totem is not merely an emblem, it is a collective label, and it is sacred.

## Totemic Animal and Man

Totems are also the objct of rites. For instance, no one from the Elk clan can touch the elk.
Blood is also often a sacred thing. Also, men and women tend to separate themselves? Men themselves are in a sacred level that is somewhat at the same level as the totem.There are at least three sacred things, the totem, the plant or animal whose appearance is the same, and the memers of the clan.

But totemism also offers a conception of the universe. In other words, they offer a system of classification

>Thus, the circle of religious things extends well beyond what at first seemed to be its boundaries. Not only are the totemic animals and the members of the clan enclosed within that circle;  but since there is nothing known that is not classified within a clan and under at totem, there is also nothing that does not receive a reflection of that religiousness, to some degree. p.155


These totems can be collective, but they can also be indiviudal!



# Origins of Totemic Beliefs

These totemic beliefs are primitive because they are mixed with clans, which are also very primitive. Organizations based on clans is the simplest we know.

Basically, totemic beliefs derive from a collective, and individual totems are derived froma  collective.

Other definitions say that tomemism is not religious, or that totems come from more primitive religions.

Totems,  then, are the "tanginble form in which the intangible substance is represented in the imagination." p.191

We all draw upon this force in the imagination, a "moral power" or "divinity"

This ultimately shows that, people begin worshipping things based on some conceptions humans derive of a spiritual force, like mana. That is, we must understand where some kind of notion of "divine" comes from, the "divine" being the spiritual force in things. It is really a drive to classify that forces groups to choose emblems, and imbue some with a divine, totemic idea? This classification is built on a kind of promitive logic. For instance, men want to ban together, and look for a way to define themselves.

## Skipping to the conclusion

You have to act and repeat acts to keep the religion fresh, to renew their effects. The regularly repeated actions are thus very important. Religion, some unanimous feeling among believers, gives some meaning to society. Society makes possible all of the feelings of religion.

>collective life awakens religious thought when it rises to a certain intensity [and] that is so because it brings about a state of effervescence that alters the cnoditions of psychic activity.

These conditions allow individuals to forumlate an ideal, but the ideal onceptions come from that rush of psychic forces. A society then has a kind of ideal counterpart, and it is the social which makes this distinction possible. s
