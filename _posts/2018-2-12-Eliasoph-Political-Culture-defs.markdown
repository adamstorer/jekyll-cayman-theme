People calim to not know about the Iran-Contra affair, why are they ignorant?

>Studying how people actually about politics may provide one key to understanding why so Americans polled express little faith in government,3 while so few change it. p. 465

We know that people do things with words, and that speech makes sense in social context. Using this, Eliasoph does an experiment of how people think they are supposed to talk about politics.

1. What is the relation between a person and their political opinions?
2. The immediate context gives meaning to words. Different framing gives people different ways of speaking. This frame was for a radio interview.

>responding. This was an effort to explore a folk definition of "public." What is "public?" What is the purpose of speaking in "public?" What is an appropriate way to speak for the public record? p.466

Some poeple tried to sound witty, and used their words to wedge themselves out of political life. Some people exaggerated their ignorance, or  spoke in hyperbolic tones. We have a few different speakers.
1. Irreverent speakers - Poeple leaving open the possibility they were not serious.
2. Intimidated Speakers - Those who said tehy were unqualified or only really spoke in cliches.
3. Concerned - More eager to send a message, beleiving what htey said matters.

## Standard Political Research and the Missing Context

TO get public opinions, you need to understand how people operate in the public with respect to their opinions. You don't get that with surveys.

SOmetimes in interviews people cannot help but make sense of the status difference, calling the other person professor.

>reporter: it does not take a Foucault to see that they all require a dif- ferent kind of "subject" to interview. I tried to draw out common assumptions of what a public subject would sound like, not in "quiet professional surroundings," but in busy and noisy ones, full of interrup- tions, usually with groups of co-workers, families, or friends. p.468

>So, if many people assume that public life happens in the media, then interviewing them for the news, as I did, is a good way to evoke public voices. It is certainly a good way to understand what people think the news is for. It also raises many other interesting ques- tions about political displays. p.469

A survey researcher misses the context, but they also miss the type of response, the sarcasm one might get from answering a quesiton.

>If everyone does not use identical methods, cultural "tools,"22 or "vo- cabularies of motives"23 for deciphering the questions, social scientists do not usually open up different groups' tool kits. Instead, they force respondents to speak seriously, forcing respondents to use a tool the respondents do not usually use, do not know how to use, or object to using p.470

When we do indepth interviews, we do not focus on how we managed to understand the different people and the different tools.

## A different approach to political opinion.

Instead, Eliasoph conducted interviews aobut the Iran-Contra affair which was meant to understand how people understand tehir relationship to the political, or their public presentations of self.

What do we get?
1. Irrevernet Speakers - Cycnical chic - They capitalize on ignorance and powerlessness to say it has nothing to do with them. They make sense of their powerlessness by making it into a joke.  

>irony. Irony can afford a safe distance from everything, not just news. It is difficult to imagine approaching some things in any other way. A state college student's job was to stand in a city plaza handing out free samples of Gatorade. Nights, he made sure to mention, he went dancing in the trendy "South of Market" area, a place known for plastic palm trees, gay country-western bars, and people wearing clothes named after decades. As for politics, he proud- ly asserted with a broad grin, "I'm lazy. Politically brain damaged, and it's my fault. p. 474

It gives the appearnce of control of their powerlessnesss, but leaves the government free to act without any popular restraint. People say they're going to do anything anyway.

2. Irreverent - Macho exaggerator - Sayig outrageous and violent things. It is about caricatures done in bravado thoughts.

>way: "The contras? I don't know. They're weird. They're a bunch of commies." "The contras?" I queried, perhaps "giving away" my surprise with a squawk. He laughed, so I laughed, too. "Well, there's something wrong with them. If there wasn't nothing wrong with them, they wouldn't get pissed off that they took the money and shit." He and his co-workers discussed who the contras were for a few more seconds, then he exclaimed. p. 476

>The point is, it was impossible to tell whether these speakers were serious or not: this young man also told me that his commission-seeking recruiter lied to him. 'All government officials are liars," he claimed. But then he went back to comic book images, this time of Nicarag p.476


>Like chic cynicism, this macho hyperbolic rhetoric makes the whole political question unreal. The other people listening to these men did not, for example, try to dissuade them from their ideas, or back them up either. The woman whose boyfriend wanted Reagan's neck cut did not take the strutting seriously. Turning toward me, she said, "No, but seriously," and then, once appropriately set apart from her unserious boyfriend, tried to outline a real position p.p477

3. Irreverent Type - Literary Critic
>the literary critic analyzes the political performance disinterestedly, cuts through the political or moral content of the show and "penetrates" right to the esthetic core of the matter. Sitting in an armchair, observing, the liter- ary critic does not pass judgement. Their key phrase is a passive, "It appears.. p.478

Irreverents do not necessarilyt hink about things as right or wrong.
>audience. Thus, a legal secretary pronounced, "It is interesting to see what aspects of the story get more attention. It hadn't been live on national networks until Ms. Hall had her say.... If anything short of a court marshal happens (to North) he'll be viewed as some sort of hero." p.478

4. Intimidated Speaker s- Willing But Unable
>these speakers seemed to acknowledge defeat, by keeping as quiet as possible about things they felt unqualified to dis- cuss. Often women, always with low-status jobs or unemployed, people of this type let me interview them by mistake. p.481

These people have serious ideas but are afraid to talk about it.

5. Intimidated Speakers - Cliche Users

People draw on cliches to make sense of things, and could be genuinely felt or just used because they are nervous.
>One man, a dentist, wanted to sound patriotic,
saying, "communism is encroaching. We have to watch our personal
Freedoms - be vigilant. We have the right to know, and freedom of
speech, but in a lot of ways that kills us. All the freedoms hinder us
because you have to do some things in secret." p.482

6. Concerned Citizens - Uninformed on Principle
These concerned citizens ar all about trying to convince people, they are uninformed but care about other things.

7. Concerened Citizens - Referring to past conversations to establish a political position.
These people wanted to tlak about deep ideas. People repeated discussions to make sense of their context and make it real.

## Content and Form

People displayed opinions, and sometimes people displayed relations towards those opinions. There are different displays.

But how can we know any sort of real speaker? What they really think?

HOw do displays realte to real political power?

What can elicit public opinions from those who do not generally speak in public?
