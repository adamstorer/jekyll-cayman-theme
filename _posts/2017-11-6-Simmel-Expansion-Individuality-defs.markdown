p. 251-293 of Individuality and Social Structures

This inquiry is of a different sort than others
>It is devoted to the
demonstration of a relational pattern, of a single pattern, even
though it emerges in conjunction with many modifications, wrappings,
and admixtures. What is common to the sections of the present
chapter is not a concept, but a proposition. Rather than pursuing
a single abstracted form in the phenomena where it happens
to appear, phenomena whose contents are not constrained in any
particular direction by the form, this chapter presents a particular
correlation, an interactionally determined pattern of development
among forms of association. p.251-2

So what is it?
>Individuality in being and action
generally increases to the degree that the social circle encompassing
the individual expands. p.252

Multiple influences means a more individual type of personality. As more individuals enter a relatively similar group, they begin to differentiate, particularly as a means to survive. This is basically a recapitulation of Durkheim's argument in DoL. These human formations all together end up becoming similar. This is also kind of like Bureaucracy in Weber.
