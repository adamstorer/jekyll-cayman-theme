title:  "Hitlin and Piliavin - Values Reviving a Dormant Concept"

Abstract: "Over the past decades, the concept of values has gone in and out of fashion within sociology. Relatively recent advances in both the conceptualization and measurement of values offer the potential for a reincorporation of values into sociological work. Sociologists often employ cursory understandings of values, imbuing values with too much determinism or viewing them as too individually subjective. The concept is employed sporadically in sociological subdisciplines. This review maps out the contours of the various approaches to linking values with culture, social structure, and individual behavior. We discuss theoretical and empirical approaches to values, organizing the broad literature to address three questions (a) What are values? (b) Where do values come from? and (c) What do values do? We identify important research findings and suggest areas for future inquiry."

People don't spend very much time thinking about values. It can refer to all sorts of things.

# What are values

Here are some problems with studying values
1. Unobservable
2. Unclear how they shape behavior
3. Unclear how values are generated
4. Difficult to measure
5. Often conflated with psychological phenomenon.
6. Vary historically and culturally

## What aren't values
More abstract than attitudes
Attitudes - Favorable or unfavorable evaluation of an object
Values are more about ideals, attitudes are more concrete. This seems bogus.
They are not traits - fixed aspects of presonality. Value-based action is more conscious.
They are not norms - situation based.

## What are values

Perhaps they are a moral compass?
Values might be:
1. Concepts or beliefs
2. About desirable end states or behaviors
3. That transcend specific situations
4. Which guide selection or evaluation of behavior and events, and
5. Are ordered by relative importance.

This is a view of values that I don'tr really beleive in. They are a model of some deep, underlying guiding beliefs. For instance, Achievemnt, Power, Hedonism, Tradition, Benevolence. If values were part of a typology of schemas, they would be on the deeper side.

Vlaues are supposed to motivate action.

>Values, commonly conceived of as ideal ends within an action situation, need to
incorporate the means through which they will be reached. p.364

Dewey argues that values shoudln't be separated from some notion of means. They are too connected. Values are teh basis of our goals, and perhaps we do not choose them for ourselves, but are soemthing like guiding mechanimss?

Values must somewhow be activated, motivational, and there must be some influence from our values onto what we pay attention to, and influence how we plan our action.

# Values Measurement

Basically they list some number of TERMINAL VALUES. Deep seated ideas. These are ridiculous. Basically, one might be asked, given all of the values, to rank the improtance of them in some way. But ranking values is kind of a wonky thing to do.

But do people even know what their values are?

# Where do Values Come From?

Biology?

Race/Ethnicity/Gender?

Social Structure?

how might values change? Attitude changes might be reflected? WHo knows

# What do values do?

They motivate action in some way.

My summary of this article is that these people are doing some crazy phenomenology here out of nowhere and I am gaining a deeper understanding of why people were ocnfused when I said I wanted to study these particular thigns. My ideas were pretty different from value in that I did not think o fthem as any more or less directly cnnected to action, not doing some phenomonology in terms of values, norms, attitudes, traits. It might be useful but it helps to contextualize some of Ann's arguments a little more.
