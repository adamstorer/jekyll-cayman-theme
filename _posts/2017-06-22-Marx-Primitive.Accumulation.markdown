# Capital Volume 1
## Part 8, Chapter 26
## The Secret of Primitive Accumulation

Access the reading [here](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm).

The previous chapters have shown a spiral of capital accumulation. We move from money to capital to surplus value to more capital, and the first set of money requires there to already be some pre-existence of masses of capital and labor power. This is the stage of primitive accumulation.
This creates a sort of myth that says hard working people make money and others spend even what they don't have. But this is a goofy thing to think. In starting points of capitalism, that is, the pre-capitalist accumulation of capital, we see more insidious forces at work.

>In actual history it is notorious that conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, briefly force, play the great part.

Once capitalist systems come into being, those who do not start with capital cannot make it through their labor alone.

>The so-called primitive accumulation, therefore, is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer from the means of production.

Once capitalism is in effect, this is already the case. In the feudal system, there were all sorts of rules about what a person could do made by guilds. While they are no longer serfs and can do different things, they also lose their protections in a capitalist society.
