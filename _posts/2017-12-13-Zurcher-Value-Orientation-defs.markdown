Abstract: "Value orientations, as components of both formal organization and individual personality, are central to the dynamics of organizational behavior. The Stouffer-Toby Role Conflict Scale was administered to 230 Mexican, Mexican-American, and Anglo-American bank em- ployees in 13 bank branches, and the results support the hypothesis that the value orientation particularism is influenced by cultural background. Since the bank is a universalistically oriented work organization, employee particularism contributes to alienation from work. The results indicated that longevity, level of position, expressed satisfaction with position, and plans to continue working in the bank are negatively related to both particularism and alienation"

Abstract:
> Value orientations, as components of both formal organization and individual personality, are central to the dynamics of organizational behavior. The Stouffer-Toby Role Conflict Scale was administered to 230 Mexican, Mexican-American, and Anglo-American bank em- ployees in 13 bank branches, and the results support the hypothesis that the value orientation "particularism" is influenced by cultural background. Since the bank is a universalistically oriented work organization, employee particularism contributes to alienation from work. The results indicated that longevity, level of position, expressed satisfaction with position, and plans to continue working in the bank are negatively related to both particularism and alienation

This has to do somewhat with the relationship between Merton's primary and secondary culture. What is the expectation of work organizations and the expectations of employees? The study is cross cultural.

One of the values people learn in their culture, is this idea of universalism vs particularism.

>Universalism, as we shall use it here, is a value orientation toward institutionalized obligations to so- ciety, and particularism is a value orienta- tion toward institutionalized obligations of friendship.

The occupation system is universalistic, those notions developed by Weber. The study takes place in Mexico, where particularism is more important apparently.

>Thus, where- as an Anglo-American tends to evaluate other individuals in terms of their accomplishments or "worth" in the eyes of society, a Mexican assesses others primarily in terms of his per- sonal relations with them, and seems less in- clined to abstract from the personal to the normative, to relate to others in an imper- sonal, objective manner. This mode of inter- personal association seems strongly to be influenced by a profound dependence on the family p.4


So, they picked a company that went across state lines, some in Mexico and some in the US.

>what if this work organization were a bureaucracy? Since a bureaucracy is force- fully universalistic in nature, might not these universalistic expectations conflict with the expectations of employees having a par- ticularistic orientation? Might not this con- flict be manifest in a measure of the degree of alienation from work? We hypothesized that in a universalistic work organization, there would be a significant positive correl- ation between employee particularism and alienation from work and that Mexicans would be significantly more alienated than Mexican-Americans, who in turn would be significantly more alienated than Anglo- America p.5

The hypotheses are that:
Particularism and Alienation would be negatively correlated with position in the bank, satisfaction, and length of employment.

The overall finding is that:
>The results tend to support the hypothesis that particularism and alienation are posi- tively correlated. That is, employees with particularistic orientations tend to be alien- ated from work in the universalistically oriented bank p.9

>Particularism, for all groups combined and within each group, is also consistently related to the other variables. Generally, particularism diminishes (and conversely, universalism increases) as: 1) length of em- ployment increases, 2) level of position in- creases, 3) satisfaction with the job increases, and 4) plans to continue with the bank as a career increase  p.10

<sum>This one makes you think - what is going on here? This is a really interesting paper, though I am kind of zoning out a little too much on it right now. It is interesting because we really have a combination of a lot of things - Weber, Marx, and Parsons in a way that is more or less empirically straightforward. The findings fly in the face of some notions of Culture, and are particularly concerning that we find this information at all. What do we think of some real divide between universalism and particularism?</sum>
