Abstract - Social theory suggests that higher levels of women’s economic power enable wives to exit unsatisfying relationships but also generate marital dissatisfaction among men. But empirical tests focusing on labor markets provide inconsistent findings. I examine the impact of wealth on marriage and divorce patterns during the historic emergence of mass divorce in the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During that period, nearly all American states passed Married Women’s Property Acts that gave married women the right to own and control property separately from their husbands. Using administrative data covering nearly all legal divorces in the United States between 1867 and 1906, I show that married women’s expanded property rights led to substantial increases in divorce, little of which can be attributed to increased selection into marriage. Increases in divorce were driven by husbands as much as by wives, suggesting that husbands chaffed at wives’ growing economic autonomy at the same time that autonomy allowed more women to end unhappy marriages. The approach illustrates the utility of property rights analysis to studying gender inequality and demographic change.

Katherine - Two things - 1. Not historicizng things as much as I thought it would. For instance, why is this a valuable time period? And 2. Is it historically significant? What is the historical context here. Is this transhistorical or not?

(Maybe there is a county or a state that you could look at in more detail that might end up )

Heather - Maybe the divorce property laws - the state level laws - should just be more specific.. Maybe you can capture time and space varying coefficients.

[Also, some of the laws are retroactive and some of the alws aren't -- I really wonder if there's some way you can take more advantage of this to say something that pushes your theory forward in terms of differential divorce rates or marriage/remarriage rates?


I guess with the DID approach you're supposed to have some random assignment of the treatment or quasi-random, and I just wonder.


The laws are
