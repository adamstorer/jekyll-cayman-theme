    What is the basic argument for Michels in Political Parties?: The basic argument is that democracy and large scale social organizations are incompatible because all large organizations require governing decision makers at the top. Thus a democratic organization quickly becomes an oligarchy.

>“Oligarchy, the control of a society or an organization by those at the top, is an intrinsic part of bureaucracy or large-scale organization. Modern man, according to him, is faced with an unresolvable dilemma: he cannot have large institutions such as nation states, trade unions, political parties, or churches, without turning over effective power to the few who are at the summit of these institutions.” p.15

This push towards bureaucratization is moved along partially by what Michels calls the incompetence of the masses. In addition, when people become bureaucrats they are so effected by their position and less by their own ideology.

This is basically all I'm going to take away from this,as far as I can tell, so this is a stopping point for me.
