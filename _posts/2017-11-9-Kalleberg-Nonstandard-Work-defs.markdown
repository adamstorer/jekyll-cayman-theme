title:  "Kalleberg - Nonstandard Employment Relations"
date:   2017-11-8 17:50:00
categories: ['Kalleberg','Work QE','Reading Notes','Annual Review']
published: true
Abstract: "Nonstandard employment relations—such as part-time work, temporary help agency and contract company employment, short-term and contingent work, and independent contracting—have become increasingly prominent ways of organizing work in recent years. Our understanding of these nonstandard work arrangements has been hampered by inconsistent definitions, often inadequate measures, and the paucity of comparative research. This chapter reviews the emerging research on these nonstandard work arrangements. The review emphasizes the multidisciplinary nature of contributions to this field, including research by a variety of sociologists, economists, and psychologists. It also focuses on cross-national research, which is needed to investigate how macroeconomic, political, and institutional factors affect the nature of employment relations. Areas for future research are suggested."

Abstract:
>Nonstandard employment relations—such as part-time work, temporary help agency and contract company employment, short-term and contingent work, and independent contracting—have become increasingly prominent ways of organizing work in recent years. Our understanding of these nonstandard work arrangements has been hampered by inconsistent definitions, often inadequate measures, and the paucity of comparative research. This chapter reviews the emerging research on these nonstandard work arrangements. The review emphasizes the multidisciplinary nature of contributions to this field, including research by a variety of sociologists, economists, and psychologists. It also focuses on cross-national research, which is needed to investigate how macroeconomic, political, and institutional factors affect the nature of employment relations. Areas for future research are suggested.

The initial story is quite Similar to Smith's treatment of flexible work. Kalleberg splits the research into five categories.
1. Part-Time Work - There are more part time workers in most of the world, more in Europe than in the US. It moved from meeting workers needs to work certain shorter hours (mostpart time work was done by women) to the damnds of the organization as part of flexible staffing. Is part time a bad job?It depends on the country, and the jobs themselves are often quite heterogenous. USually workers receive less benefits in the US.
2. Temp Agencies - Modern day reserve labor army that helps employers solve problems. This is the other side of flexible work. A small core and then many temps. There is a strange relationship between the individual, the agency, and the organization, and soemtimes workers are the employees of staffing agencies and sometimes they're not. The difficulty of control here makes it difficult to organize. Working as a temp is also temporary, though some people hope to be converted to permanent. The jobs are usually bad.
3. Short-Term Work
4. Contingent Work
5. Independent Contracting

Kalleberg repeats a standard formula over different kinds of work. It's kind of boring and I would put it on recommended reading probably.
