Access this reading in the Marx-Engels Reader 26-52.

Basically, this piece is using the question of jewish political freedom to make the case for the distinction between political freedom and freedom in general/economic freedom. And the germans are not economically free. Bauer argues we have to emancipate ourselves before we can emancipate others.

If you are a german jew, and you refuse to be a jew before a german, then you should be a second class citizen (I believe this is Bauer.) "Thus Bauer demands, on the one hand, that the Jew should renounce Judaism, and in general that man should renounce religion in order to be emancipated as a citizen. On the other hand, he considers, and this follows logically, that the political abolition of religion is the abolition of all religion." p. 29 But what kind of state are we emancipated to?

Here Marx turns to a criticism of Bauer, because political emancipation is only one part of the whole.

But what are the limits of political emancipation? Man is not really liberated, only in an abstract and narrow way. WE still have property even if we are politically emancipated, and people legislate mostly to protect their property (or because they have property?), so abolishing property would create more freedom. To bring man back into the community you need more than to make them political equals, you need to make them equals with respect to property.

>What prevails in the so-called Christian state is not man but
alienation . The only man who counts-the King-is specifically differentiated
from other men and is still a religious being associated .
directly with heaven and with God . The relations which exist here
are relations still based upon faith. The religious spirit is still not
really secularized p.38

>We do not say to the Jews, therefore, as does Bauer : you cannot
be emancipated politically without emancipating yourselves completely
from Judaism. We say rather : it is because you can be
emancipated politically, without renouncing J udaism completely
and absolutely, that political emancipation itself is not human
emancipation .


>H uman emancipation will only be complete when the real, individual
man has absorbed into himself the abstract citizen; when as
an individual man, in his everyday life, in his work, and in his relationships,
he has become a species-being; and when he has recogn
ized and organized his own powers ( forces propre s ) as social
powers so that he no longer separates this social power from himself
as political power. p.46

And then we get into the last part of the argument, which is that the essence of judaism is huckstering, and his god is money, and we need to emancipate ourselves from this religious idea.

>An organization of society which would abolish the preconditions
and thus the very possibility of huckstering, would make
the Jew impossible . His religious consciousness would evaporate like
some insipid vapour in the real, life-giving air of soCiety p.48
