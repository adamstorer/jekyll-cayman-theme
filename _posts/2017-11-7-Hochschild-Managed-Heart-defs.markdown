    A Feeling for Hochschild: Like emotion, a feeling is a sense. One has such a sensation and it communicates certain information
    Transmutation of an emotional system: The link between a private act, such as enjoying a party, and a public act, such as summoning up good feeling for a customer. It is the movement of something we do privately to something that we do for a profit motive
    Emotional Dissonance: Maintaining a difference between feeling and feigning over the long run leads to strain. WE try to reduce this strain by pulling the two closer together either by changing what we feel or by changing what we feign.

What does it mean for a person to be an instrument of labor? What does it mean if your paid to smile instead of paid to operate a machine?

The flight attendant seems like they have a good life, but there are some unexpected similarities to a factory worker. Part of the service the flight attendant renders is an emotional style. Factory worker must do emotional labor.
>This labor requires one to induce or suppress feeling in order to sustain the outward countenance that produces the proper state of mind in others. p.

In both situations workers become estranged/alienated from an aspect of the self: body and mind.

What happens when people distance themselves from themselves?

We concern ourselves with three concepts here:
1. Labor - Jobs are becoming service oriented and are less and less something a person takes pride in.
2. Display - From Goffman, we are focused on the work that goes into interaction in order to deal with people.  
3. Emotion - What is an emotion and how can we manage it

Emotional labor likely cuts through many types of jobs. Often times it means attempting to feel certain types of emotions, something that is an interesting take.

<def>A Feeling for Hochschild: Like emotion, a feeling is a sense. One has such a sensation and it communicates certain information</def>

We try to apply feeling rules to ourselves, that should determine whether or not we should sense a sense. Sometimes this works.

The question is, what happens when the managing of emotion comes to be used as labor?
<def>Transmutation of an emotional system: The link between a private act, such as enjoying a party, and a public act, such as summoning up good feeling for a customer. It is the movement of something we do privately to something that we do for a profit motive</def>

I am not sure about this type of alienation. Certain standards of practice are imposed on us at all times, and the distinction between a private and a public doesn't really equate as much.

Now our emotions are instruments of profits.


Hochschild is discussing feeling with respect to private and public life in order to draw out a kind of sociology of emotion. We are concerned with how that deals with work, so we focus on 89-185

# Part Two - Public Life
Hochschild acts, what happens to a person's feelings/face when they are asked at work to manage that feeling/face?
>When worked-up warmth becomes an instrument of service work, what can a person learn about herself from her feelings? And when a worker abandons her work smile, what kind of tie remains between her smile and her self? p.90

The problem with this is that we need a deeper theory of the self here. We cannot strip the emotion aspect of identity from other aspects of how identity works, right? And display at some point comes to a certain set of feelings.

This is super common in the airline industry. Airlines compete with each other partially by selling a particular attitude. But this seems to redefine steward/ess work overall.

People are even selected to be/seem happy. It is in the manual! It is in  the interview! It is mandated!

For instance, there is an "animation test" whre they are supposed to have a warm personality

Employees often wonder what section of the personality will be under company control. For instance, you also can't be out all night when you're a stewardess. You also have to weigh in. Different airlines have different standards regarding these things. They don't care at all about your deeply held beliefs.

People try and trick themselves into being nice/feeling positively for a customer. Are these responses spontaneous? People do this by pretending that others are nice or guests in their home, but they have a hard time when passengers don't act this way. They are also supposed to be selling at the same time that they're working.

People do all sorts of things to try and make sure to act in a certain way, and many of these are mental tricks to help people empathize. The company gives strategies for managing feeling, for instance by trying to think about what the other person is feeling, or remember that eventually you can escape.

Flight attendants work with each other to help maintain an emotional core of some kind. "The needed mood determines the nature of the worker's talk" p.115 You need team solidarity in some way, but in addition to improving morale, it can also be the basis for sharing grudges. There is also some sense of supervision in that people may be asked how they did.

Transmutation of emotion work into the public sphere requires three components.
1. Emotion Work - People must try and make themselves feel differently, and this is done not only by the individual but also by the company.
2. Feeling Rules - Rules about how to act and what to do in situations are codified and distributed. Hochschild calls these lessons in deep acting.
3. Social Exchange - Coworkers may sometimes diffuse the situation here.

Braverman argues the mind leaves the work and moves up the bureaucracy, and this applies to emotion labor where the rules are given on high.

Hochschild says deep acting and feeling rules lead to another kind of deskilling, that is, the mind of the emotion worker is supposed to be controlled.

When people resist, it is often through subverting these rules.

### The Redefined Self
If you do emotional labor all day, here's what you have to thinka bout:
1. How can I really identify with my work role and the company without being fused with them? - Sometimes people have to depersonalize themselves, taking criticism as shortcomings of the work rather than perosnal shortcomings. People want to fuse company and individual success/satisfaction. But where is real and acted self? What happens when this is testeD? Some workers believe the real self is the non work self.
2. How can I use my capacities when I'm disconnected from those I am acting for? Work pressures preclude some from being able to do deep acting, and end up seeming phony. Work pressure results in a disconnect between individuals and their work.
3. If I'm doing deep acting for an audience from whom I'm disconnected, how can I maintain my self-esteem without becoming cynical? - When people act happy for people they're not really connected to how do they react? They may distance themselves from appreciation of the job, some say they act like a robot.

In each sense, the sense of self is tested.


### The Toe and The Heel

Sometimes people have to be mean instead of being nice. Consider the bill collector.
