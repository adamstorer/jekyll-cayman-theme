A 2017 Article in ASR, "Why Elites Love Authentic Lowbrow Culture: Overcoming High-Status Denigration with Outsider Art" by Hahl, Zuckerman, and Kim continues an ongoing debate about "univores" and "omnivore" etc. that begins with Peterson and Berger (1975) and is continuing to be worked on by Amir Goldberg, Omar Lizardo, and a few others.

Here is a quote from the article:
>Having clarified why and when lowbrow culture appears authentic to elite audiences, let us now turn to our main question of why certain high-status consumers find authentic culture appealing. Our argument in this regard is two-fold: (1) there is a systematic tendency for high-status actors to feel they are lacking in authenticity; and (2) such actors hold the reasonable belief, however subconscious, that they can address this perceived shortage of authenticity by demonstrating appreciation for authentic culture.

I have doubts about this argument.
It seems like high-status actors, do not necessarily feel they lack in authenticity due to status alone.
Instead there is perhaps a subgroup of high-status actors who might be susceptible to "authenticity critiques" if the arguments were made by some.
In contemporary America, it seems like we are in a cultural period where "high status" and the cultural tastes that come with it are more often under attack than consecrated.
