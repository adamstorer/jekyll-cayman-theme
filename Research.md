 My research is generally dedicated to understanding how values, conventions, and norms (VCNs) develop and spread between individuals in society. I am interested in studying these from any angle, whether it be how individuals come to internalize VCNs, to how these VCNs are modified or respond to policy changes. I believe general research into how VCNs develop is of extreme importance to sociology, and is of fundamental importance to more general research questions. Currently, I am exploring these questions within three empirical situations.

### Organizational Culture in Software Development

This project focuses on how certain domain-specific conventions emerge and spread within the field of software development, with a particular focus on how individuals internalize practices as they work on different projects within an organization. This work demonstrates the lasting effect of context develops, and in particular analyzes the differences between context at an individuals initial moment in an organization and more recent experiences.

### Job Satisfaction at Walmart

With Adam Reich, I am working on a project studying how minimum wage increases affect job satisfaction at the largest employer in the United States. This project is meant to uncover the underlying value judgements that relate to job satisfaction. Specifically, the project details how the organizational response to minimum wage increases effects the perceived hierarchy within the organization, and how the disruption of this hierarchy effects job satisfaction.

### Health and the Practices of Physicians

As part of an ongoing project using All-Payers Claim Data, I am studying how a range of practices spread among physicians.
